They both carry baggage from the past. This is not necessarily baggage, but their past is always causing complications in their present. We all believe in Jack and Mel’s love for each other, but we also know that this was a big complication.”</p><p>Sue also suggested that the prospective fourth season would give more answers about a lingering mystery: <a href=#>Who shot Jack at his bar at the end of Season 3?</a> “I will say if we get to go into a Season 4 that the audience will be genuinely surprised at who’s behind all of it,” she said.</p><p>She went on: “If given a Season 4 — knock wood — we wrap up actually what started as them being kidnapped, the introduction of Calvin [David Cubitt] and Jimmy [Ian Tracey], so we bring it all home, and then we open up a new avenue of ‘Oh my God’ at the end of Season 4. [Laughs] So the story is not over, but it continues. We’ll find that even if you believe someone’s innocent, proving that they’re innocent is much more difficult.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7azs8inZKuhppq%2Fbr%2FEmqqopl1p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Following the news of that disastrous set, many wanted to better understand what exactly happened.</p><p>After he was pulled offstage, Nick offered an apology to his fans, saying that he would "make it up" to them. Mostly, though, people just wanted to understand what exactly had led to such a disastrous set in the first place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Nick Swardson?</h2><p>Thanks to a series of videos posted on social media, we know that Nick appeared to be incapable of performing his full act at the Vilar Performing Arts Center. In one video, he is seen promising to do an impression of Jason Statham in The Beekeeper, but keeps revving up to perform the impression without actually ever doing so.</p><p>The audience was understandably restless, and began booing him.</p><p>"Do you want me to finish this, or no?" he asked the crowd, to which many replied "No!"</p><p>In another video, Nick can be seen getting escorted offstage, and a another man comes onto the stage and says that he is the venue's director of operations.</p><p style=text-align:start>"We've decided to conclude the show early in the best interest of those who bought tickets," he explained. "We apologize for what you've seen tonight. Please email the box office. We'll be responding to inquiries and processing credits and refunds."</p><p>Prior to being escorted off the stage, it appeared that Nick's mic had already been turned off. The following day, Nick addressed his bombing on social media, trying to keep things light.</p><p>"Just casually woke up on TMZ," <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>. "Travel tip: Don't drink and take edibles in high altitude. F--king brain diarrhea. I'll make it up to you, Beaver Creek!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just casually woke up on TMZ. Travel tip: don’t drink and take edibles in high altitude.

Unfortunately, this show did not meet the Vilar Performing Arts Center's standards as a world-class presenter of the performing arts," an email to attendees read.</p><p>"Therefore, all tickets will be refunded to the original payment method," the statement continued. "Please accept our sincere apologies, and be in touch if there is anything we can do to further assist you."</p><p>Nick's apology was a little less fulsome, but it seems like he plans to find a way to make amends with the people who were at the performance.</p><p>What shape those amends might take remains unclear at this point, but it seems like Nick's poor performance was simply a result of indulging himself a bit too much. He plans to continue his tour and is likely hoping that this incident will ultimately blow over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSnoZOgerTDwKubrKee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

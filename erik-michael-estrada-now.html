In Dirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam, we start with Pearlman's somewhat humble beginnings in Queens, N.Y. and learn how the boy band bonanza took off. Featured in the docuseries are a few of the men, formerly boys, who began their careers with the controversial talent manager.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erik-Michael Estrada</a> got his start in O-Town, which was born after the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC severed ties with Pearlman.</p><p>The "All or Nothing" singer is seen in archival footage of MTV's <a href=#>Making The Band</a>, where he discusses how he didn't feel like he had a place in the group. After the band split up in 2002, Erik briefly dipped his toes into acting.</p><p>So, where is Erik-Michael Estrada now? He occasionally still hangs out in O-Town.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Erik-Michael Estrada up to now? He's still performing.</h2><p>In June 2024, Erik-Michael popped into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The TMZ Podcast</a> where he chatted about being part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop2000 tour</a>. Along with three members of his O-Town fam, Erik-Michael was performing with BBMak, Ryan Cabrera, and LFO. The mega boy band event was hosted by former NSYNC member Chris Kirkpatrick, and has been going strong since 2019. And before you ask, Ashley will not be returning to the group anytime soon.</p><p>When asked about what touring felt like as an adult man in his 40s, versus a young guy in his 20s, Erik-Michael said the most difficult part is the recovery time. He joked about needing a lot of Epsom salt baths.</p><p>What Erik-Michael lacks in whacky stories, he makes up for in dedication. He told the podcast hosts that in the decade since most of O-Town had reunited, not a single member has ever missed a show.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Erik-Michael Estrada related to Erik Estrada?</h2><p>In a world filled with <a href=#>nepo babies</a>, it's refreshing to find an entertainer who made it on his own. Erik-Michael Estrada is not in fact related to actor Erik Estrada, who was catapulted to fame thanks to the hit show CHiPs, which ran from 1977 to 1983.</p><p>Clearly people assumed Erik-Michael was Erik Estrada's son, which might have been better for the O-Town member who was estranged from his own father.</p><p>During one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upsetting scene from Making The Band</a>, Erik-Michael calls his father after not speaking to him for quite some time. When his dad picks up, Erik-Michael uses his first name and has to identify himself.</p><p>Erik-Michael is clearly shaken by the experience, as he suggests setting up a time to meet. He also accuses his father of suddenly being interested in spending time together after seeing him on television.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by EM Estrada (@iamerikestrada)</a></p></figure><p>Erik-Michael's father is hesitant about the meeting because he claims he doesn't want to air any family grievances on camera. He says this is a cultural thing and it's something Latin people don't do.</p><p>To his credit, Erik-Michael doesn't force the situation and is fine with his dad needing to call him back. It's unclear if Erik-Michael ever repaired the relationship with his father. Either way, he seems to be doing pretty well for himself nowadays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2Bqt4ymoJygkZq5brHSramanJFiu7DD</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

Fans of I Am Jazz watched Jazz Jennings on her journey as a transgender woman from the time she was a kid. And those closest to her, including her older brother Sander Jennings, have made it their mission to make sure they help others like her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And those closest to her, including her older brother <a href=#>Sander Jennings</a>, have made it their mission to make sure they help others like her. But some fans feel like Sander's activism is a little much.</p><p>They've discussed on Twitter that they believe Sander's heart is in the right place but that he sometimes comes across as "disingenuous" by showing how "woke" he is. One fan on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> wrote that they believe Sander's activism is "staged." That's not necessarily true, but there are plenty of viewers who had thoughts about Sander's activism on I Am Jazz during Season 7.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Sander in 'I Am Jazz.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sander Jennings is an LGBTQ activist.</h2><p>Like Jazz and their parents, Greg and Jeanette Jennings, Sander is an activist for the LGTBQ community. He explains on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, "Ever since my sister transitioned back in 2005, I have dedicated [myself] to fighting for inclusion and diversity. Through my appearances on TLC's I am Jazz, I have served as a positive role model for properly loving and supporting your LGBTQ+ sibling."</p><p>He teamed up with comedian and fellow activist Noah LeAnder Boutilier on I Am Jazz to make a video about transgender men being men. In the video, Sander and Noah appear with their shirts off and they take turns explaining how they're the same despite one of them being transgender. It's an important message and one that shouldn't be taken lightly.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sander is annoying i love that he supports Jazz but he tries to put the attention on him. Why is the content room full of rainbows ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>#IAmJazz</a></p>â€” Kayla (@xkayrose_) <a href=#>December 16, 2021</a></figure><p>But the fact that Sander is part of the message made some viewers feel yet again that Sander's work for the community makes it appear that he tries too hard. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan</a> shared on Twitter that to them, "It's not endearing. It's uncomfortable."</p><p>To be fair, Sander is often the center of different scenes on the show. But he has always been in his sister's corner. And his cause seems genuine, even if some viewers believe he comes across as someone who does too much.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Sander's job outside of 'I Am Jazz'?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, Sander is an "influencer" by trade and, he uses his online presence to make a difference and build relationships with different brands. He also works as a marketing consultant for Pride Palace, a clothing brand he started in 2019. Its mission is to be inclusive and encourage social justice.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Iâ€™m tired of Sanders being woke. Seems disingenuous. <a href=#>#IAmJazz</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kao7CkBC36</a></p>â€” yeah. (@BOTCHEDBBL) <a href=#>December 15, 2021</a></figure><p>And since Sander's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> bio says he's a "digital marketing expert," he likely uses those skills to further his career as an influencer. It's only natural for him to want to speak out on behalf of his sister, especially since he's so ingrained in the community. But it hasn't stopped <a href=#>I Am Jazz fans</a> from discussing how they view Sander's very blatant woke-ness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6vsMSrZKOdnqO2r7PSZpicrJmrtrS5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

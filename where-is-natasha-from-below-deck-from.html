Source: BravoAs Below Deck Mediterranean set sail for its seventh season, fans of the Bravo reality show met the new chief stewardess, Natasha Webb. Unfortunately, reviews among the Below Deck family have so far been mixed.
In one episode, for example, Captain Sandy Yawn praised Natasha’s work with guests but criticized her for the “filth” that’s left downstairs on the yacht at night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s not easy to watch.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Even worse, former Below Deck Mediterranean chief stew <a href=#>Hannah Ferrier</a> said in a podcast interview that Natasha “doesn’t sound like interesting television,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Here’s what else we know about Natasha.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Below Deck’ star Natasha Webb is a chief stew from the Yorkshire area of England.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Bravo</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo bio</a>, Natasha hails from a small town in the English countryside of West Yorkshire. (Other celebrities from the Yorkshire area include Judi Dench, Patrick Stewart, Jodie Whittaker, Ed Sheehan, Lena Headey, and Zayn Malik, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallam FM</a> reports.)</p><p>Earlier in her career, Natasha “developed a strong work ethic” as she took on a variety of jobs, including schoolteacher, actress, nanny, bartender, and golf caddy. But she’s been focusing on yachting for the last 10 years.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Always ready to welcome charter guests with a charming smile and a craft cocktail, she prides herself on her leadership style that is equal parts fair and flare,” Bravo adds.</p><p style=text-align:start>Natasha is also the director of Indie-Pearl, a yachting recruitment agency. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bio on the agency’s website</a> reveals that she has gone from working as a stewardess to working as a chief stew and purser for 100-meter-plus superyachts. “Natasha feels that there is always a yacht out there for everyone, and is confident she can help find that particular one for each crew member,” the bio adds.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yes, knows she looks like costar Natalya Scudder, and she’s “absolutely over the moon” about it.</h2><p style=text-align:start>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BravoTV.com</a>, Natasha and Below Deck Mediterranean costar Natalya Scudder discussed their similar appearances. “Is this my sister? Is this my twin?” Natalya joked. “We’re like twins almost, yeah.”</p><p style=text-align:start>The resemblance thrills Natasha, though. “I am absolutely over the moon to be called Natalya’s twin, because she’s super hot,” Natasha said. “She’s way more gorgeous than me, so I’ll take that. I mean, she’s stunning. She’s got a body like a supermodel. She’s just such a beautiful person, inside and out. It’s really nice to be called her twin.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Natasha did share a way to tell her and Natalya apart, however: “I’m the one with the crazy Yorkshire accent, and Natalya’s the one with the Australian accent. If people know accents well, then they’re gonna know instantly. You definitely cannot mistake my accent. My accent’s pretty unique.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlnpbBor%2FHmmSfqp%2BieqOxy6iuZpyVmLhustGopA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

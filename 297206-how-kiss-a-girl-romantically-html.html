However, how to kiss a girl romantically may seem scary and confusing. What if you bump her head? What if you miss the spot? How about if she runs away or pushes you back? Disgusting, right?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/2e45555889867788.jpeg><p class=align-left>Every man wants to master the kissing art (yes, you read it right). It may not be easy to learn this art. However, with practice and preparation, you can nail it. Here, we will walk you through the entire process including tips on how to set the mood and many more.</p><h2>Before meeting up with her</h2><p class=align-left>Before meeting up with her, make sure you do the following to increase chances of kissing her like a pro.</p><h3>1. Brush your teeth</h3><p class=align-left>Brush your teeth to keep smelling gums at bay. You can also use mints and mouthwash to maintain a fresh breath during the date. Most importantly, watch what you eat before the date. Avoid onions, garlic, smoking, coffee, tuna and tobacco. Bad breaths are turn offs and can make the kissing move from a beautiful to a horror experience. Don’t allow this to ruin your chances! Do whatever it takes to avoid smelly gums.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a8d0aaa6f1daf7b9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ dope captions for Instagram for boys and girls in 2021</span></p></a><h3>2. Take a shower</h3><p class=align-left>A romantic kiss is not based on the mouth only; other body parts are involved too. Even if you are not going to kiss for long, it is nice to have the whole body prepared. Take a shower, wash your armpits and properly style your beard (If you have one). Use a little fragrance – girls love good scents. Use a good perfume that suits the occasion. However, be careful not to overdo it. If you use it correctly, she will feel lucky to embrace you. If you don’t use perfumes, skip it.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to kiss better: Top tips and techniques</p><h3>3. Soften your lips</h3><p class=align-left>Are cracked lips appealing? No. They are irritating when it comes to kissing. Moreover, they can hurt or injure your girl’s lips. For these reasons, it is wise to balm them up few minutes before the date. While doing this, avoid using fragrant balms since from a girl’s view that will not be masculine. Girls don’t expect men’s lips to smell/taste like vanilla, strawberry or peach.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6f4af11068c796f8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny captions for selfies for Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp</span></p></a><h2>Setting the kissing mood</h2><p class=align-left>Now you have brushed your teeth, took a shower, softened your lips, and you have gone to meet her. So, how do you set up a kissing mood such that she also wants to kiss you?</p><h3>1. Get her to a secluded place</h3><p class=align-left>Some girls don’t like to be kissed in public. They will always think that you are trying to show her off to people. So, how do you pull your girlfriend from the public? Use the following tactics.</p><ul><li>If in public, communicate your needs confidently. Also, at least hold her hands, shoulders or touch her while talking.</li><li>Ask her out! It will work well since chances of rejection are low.</li><li>Another trick is to offer to walk her home.</li></ul><h3>2. Setting the mood</h3><p class=align-left>It’s now time to set up the kissing mood. Find a somehow dark or soft-lit spot with little light. Soft-lit spots are considered to be romantic. If it’s at night, you can rely on moonlight. At daytime, consider meeting up when the sun is setting down.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fdc011da5434e472.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ lion motivational quotes on strength, fearlessness, success, positivity</span></p></a><h3>3. Light up the conversation</h3><p class=align-left>Keep her busy with enchanting conversation to avoid dull moments. Be sure to avoid some topics that can be disgusting or encourage revolting. You should not talk about any of these topics.</p><ul><li>Criticising her friends, neighbour or even your ex-girlfriend. Stay away from the subject.</li><li>Stop complaining. It is a big turn off so stay positive minded and never bring up life issues or anything you don’t like.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Instead, talk about the following:</p><ul><li>Her interests, thoughts and hobbies. It will make her more interested in having a conversation with you.</li><li>Things you have in common with her. Think of your past experiences that you share with her and talk about them</li><li>Tell her how amazing you think she is.</li><li>You can also talk about music, sports, food, games, memes, crazy stuff, share jokes, any random thing and so on.</li></ul><h3>4. Compliment her</h3><p class=align-left>What you talk about before kissing can smoothen your road. Make your conversations lip-locking by use of compliments. Shower her with lots of compliments. However, be keen not to overdo it. Also, don’t lie to her be genuine – if she’s ugly don’t tell her that she is beautiful. The chances are that she already knows that and by lying to her you are spoiling your chances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/179ed137de93c0f8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>200+ best comments for a boy's pic on Instagram to compliment him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Good compliments show girls that you care about them and you always pay attention to what she wears, looks or says. If she has dimples and you like them, or she smiles nicely, or maybe you like how she laughs, express yourself. Don’t compliment her physical features such as butt, figure, or weight. Here are some examples:</p>Hey, your smile is dazzling.Your voice is my favourite sound.Honestly, I like your dimples.<p class=align-left>Lastly, when complimenting her, use a passionate voice. It can be achieved by smoothing your voice a little bit, leaning forward slightly and changing your tone to convey intimacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a8d0aaa6f1daf7b9.jpeg><h3>5. Make physical contact</h3><p class=align-left>It’s not wise to start kissing a girl without first making physical contact, and in some cases, she may even push you back. Start by touching her lightly to know if she is open. You must keep it natural and monitor her body language. How is she responding? Is she open and comfortable to your light touch?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7222f56bbfd3a256.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing badass quotes for men</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are some tips for you:</p><ul><li>If you are watching a movie or she is just seated next to you, move closer to her such that your arms slightly brush hers. Make sure your knees are in contact. How did she respond? If she moves closer to you that is a good sign.</li><li>Touch her when you talk. Go further and hold her hands. How does she react to that?</li><li>If you were walking her home, hug her while saying goodbye.</li></ul><h2>Going for a romantic kiss</h2><p class=align-left>It’s time to kiss your girl like a pro. To make it memorable, do the following:</p><h3>1. Make eye contact and shut up</h3><p class=align-left>Before a romantic kiss, there must be silence. Make intense eye contact with her without saying anything. Be confident, don’t blush. Linger for a few seconds and let her know that something special is about to take place through the golden silence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c080f0700572d346.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Stare deeply into your girl's eyes and compliment her. You can also tell her special things like “You are beautiful” or “I like you” and not “I love you”. The two phrases may look generic, but they are not - they mean a lot to girls. Make sure whatever you say you mean it.</p><p class=align-left>Now, you have set a romantic mood between you and her. She might even respond by saying that she likes you too. Now your lover space is about to blast!</p><h3>2. Be sure that she wants it</h3><p class=align-left>Putting your lips on another person’s mouth should not be taken lightly. It is very invasive. How do you know that she wants to kiss you? There are two methods you can use here:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask for permission:</strong> Asking for permission can be beneficial since you will know if she wants to kiss you. This is great especially if you are kissing your girl for the first time. If a girl wants to kiss you, she won’t care even if you ask her for permission.</li><li><strong>Don’t ask for permission. </strong>Gentlemen don’t ask for a kiss. They take it. This is the most romantic way you can use to kiss your girl. You can always tell if a girl is ready to kiss you by keenly observing her body language.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/37680e627e1181e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Types of kisses and their meaning (with images)</p><h3>3. Kiss her!</h3><p class=align-left>Kissing is awesome. Slowly enter her personal space. Head straight to her lips and pause few centimetres from her lips. If she doesn’t push you back, you are good to go. In some cases, the girl will automatically come to meet your lips. Here are some tips to kiss her like a pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Slightly open your mouth when going in for a kiss.</strong> Be romantic, open your lips slightly and be prepared to kiss her. Do not gap like a dog; lips should be barely apart like you are about to utter a word. When you enter with a closed mouth, she might think that all you want is a small peck which is not romantic.</li><li><strong>Avoid collisions. </strong>When approaching her, do not forget to tilt your head to prevent collisions. If possible, you can guide your girl to tilt her head in the opposite direction. Please guide her carefully, slowly, softly and not like an auto part assembling the robot. For instance, you can start by caressing her cheeks and then eventually moving them sideways. Don’t be afraid, be confident – if she wanted to date electric wires, she wouldn’t have gone this far with you. Loosen up.</li><li><strong>Eyes closed. </strong>Maintain your eyes closed. It is not romantic for a girl to open her eyes only to find you staring at her manically. Closing eyes is a sign of enjoyment so keep your eyes closed until the kiss is over. In some cases, this can pass a message to the girl that you love her so much.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bdb8452dc9809e9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top quotes about haters hating on your relationship</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6f4af11068c796f8.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Kiss like a pro. </strong>Awesome! Now keep it soft. Suddenly back and look straight into her eyes, give her a second kiss if she seems to be into it. This time, make it deeper. Continue kissing her for some time and let her enjoy it. Focus on kissing the upper lip. Do not use your tongue in this step. Take her upper lip into your mouth. Do it gently so that no one is hurt.</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Making out: meaning, techniques and tips</p><ul><li><strong>Make use of your hands. </strong>Wow! It’s time to use your hands. Kissing isn’t about lips only; the rest of the body is involved too. Hands don’t kiss, but they have a significant role in making your kiss more romantic. Here are some things you can do while kissing her:</li></ul><li>Touch her neck and face by use of your hands.</li><li>Gently caress her hair. Let this be natural by doing it slowly.</li><li>You can also put them on her waist.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9e558a5b681a2742.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dry sense of humor meaning and jokes</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Use your tongue wisely. </strong>The tongue is one of the essential body parts that contribute to a romantic kiss. Let your excitement not temper with your tongue. It is not right to thrust and waggle your tongue in her mouth as if you are drilling a borehole.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Introduce your tongue gently to her mouth. Pull it back and in slowly. Repeat this motion only. Note that you aren’t supposed to keep your whole tongue inside her mouth for long, flick it widely, jam it in repeatedly or lick her lips or face. She will bring out her tongue too. Welcome the move gently with moderation.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your saliva at bay.</strong> Excessive saliva makes a kiss irritating and sloppy. When you continue kissing, your mouth tends to make more of it. So how do you handle this?</li></ul><p class=align-left>If saliva fills up in your mouth, don’t be afraid of pulling back to swallow it. This will provide a moment to take an in-depth look into her eyes. For your own sake, never spit saliva or wipe your mouth during this instance. The girl may think that her mouth is smelly or tasting bad and she will not be willing to kiss you again.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/40799ba2dd4e2f3c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 of the best long lasting perfumes for men</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Don’t rush.</strong> If a kiss was like the most expensive food in the country, would you gap it down fast or slowly? You would enjoy the food bite by bite while taking your time before biting the last crumb. The same applies to kiss; you should take your time. Enjoy every moment of the kiss, immerse yourself into it and kiss slowly. It will heighten your kissing experience.</li><li><strong>Breath. </strong>Don’t make a mistake of holding up your breath such that you will come out gasping for oxygen like an ocean diver. When you want to breathe, end the kiss and move to kiss her ears, cheek or neck area.</li><li><strong>Smile.</strong> Smile as you pull away. Nothing is more romantic and fits better than a simple smile after a great kiss. She will respond by smiling too. Be a gentleman, give her an honest compliment and go back to kissing her slightly. Here you have the golden chance of telling her something special. You can compliment her looks or express your feelings towards her.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a583364f385986f1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing tips and tricks to make your make out session unforgettable</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now you know how to kiss a girl romantically.

On our way back to the car, I said to my wife, who am I but for Jesus,” Adeboye said.</p><p>The revered cleric then painted a picture of his humble background, disclosing that as the son of a farmer, he was so poor that poor people called him poor.</p><p>He said further, “only recently when I wanted to go home by helicopter, the pilots looked at the map of Nigeria and they couldn’t find my village, things are different now, they have put it on the point now.</p><p>“The point I am making now is this, standing before you is the son of a nobody, himself a nobody, born in an unknown place but he met Jesus and that changed everything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49vZqJlmJbDpnnNqJmonKliwbB505qjpGWkpHqpu9Zmp6udo56xprrTZpmen5easW6yzqtkmpyVl7y6sdJmmK2slaPBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

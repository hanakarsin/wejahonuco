However, his past relationships expand much deeper than that. There were rumors that Tom and his Crimson Peak co-star <a href=#>Jessica Chastain</a> were dating back in 2013 that never ended up amounting to anything.

In other words, people were connecting the dots with how fast she moved on from <a href=#>Calvin Harris</a> to Tom.</p><p>Tom's relationships with all of the aforementioned stars are water under the bridge now that he's about to tie the knot with Zawe and become a father.</p><p>Congratulations to the happy couple as they take this next big step in their relationship together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyueceim52klajBsLqMnZitoZ6c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

When their enemies wanted to beat them, science dictated a merger would work out fine and that was done with President Tinubu’s Action Congress of Nigeria and Buhari’s Congress for Progressives Change. Some PDP members also left to join this merger hurting themselves because many of them are back in the party now.</p><p>“Who are they merging with? Have they talked to Peter Obi and his Obidient followers? Who will be the captain of this merger? Will the 13 PDP governors agree to a change of name and subsume themselves under an arrangement that they don’t know?</p><p>“They are going to spend the next 20 years struggling and fighting themselves on who is going to be President because all of them want to be President at the same time….rather than all this drama, the party should rather reform itself and see how this will boost its membership and elevate its ratings and acceptance. We lost an election, but that doesn’t mean we can’t win again once we look inward and correct our mistakes. People must see what we are offering and doing differently.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5ByZq2gn6iybq%2FApaOippdis7C%2BjJpkpp2inLKzecCrnGakka%2FGbsDHoqWknaKoerGwz2aaoaGVm8Gitc1mqqivpaO6qns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

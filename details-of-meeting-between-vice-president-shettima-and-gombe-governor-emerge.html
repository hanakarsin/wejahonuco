We are a mixture of people of several ethnic groups and religions living together peacefully. Within a family, you can have people of different faiths but having the same parents and because of that, the background is so unique that we have built on it to sustain the relationship.</p><p>“Secondly the government is focused on security and is working day and night together with the security agencies in the State to ensure that there is compliance with law and order and that is feasible to a reasonable extent in Gombe.</p><p>“Then there are issues that have to do with resources especially land, because our people are peasant farmers, those involved in crop production and livestock production so in-between, because of the encroachment of our grazing and forest reserves plus the cattle routes, issues resulted into rustling, banditry and kidnap for ransom, which is prevalent in the North-West and North-Central.</p><p>“So, at the moment we are focusing on maintaining the peace by providing resources for everybody and every sector in a way that we always understand and cooperate with one another for the purpose of sustaining peace and tranquillity in the State and that is why Gombe has made some difference,” he said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-712877 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/F0x97ZUXsAEQHNf.jpg alt="Details Of Meeting Between Vice President Shettima And Gombe Governor Emerge" width=1748 height=1240 sizes="(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-712877 class=wp-caption-text>Gov Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya and Vice President Kashim Shettima</p><h2>Tackling The Challenges Of Flooding</h2><p>On the menace of flooding, Gov Yahaya described it as a global phenomenon but called on all stakeholders to work together to salvage the situation. He called for both proactive and reactive actions in tackling the challenge.</p><p>He said: “You see flooding too is a global or national phenomenon that really is being felt elsewhere. Mind you, if you talk of flood from the north is either through the tributaries of the rivers, Niger and Benue, that link up the conference in Lokoja and then run down to the Delta ending in Bayelsa to the Atlantic Ocean and those tributaries as a result of the change in the nature and geography. There is siltation, a lot of siltation and also as a result of poor farming practices, and deforestation, the forest and our farms have now turned into a gateway for the desert. And those exacerbated sanitation that takes place along the streams and rivers. So we must work as one people.</p><p>“The problem of flooding is virtually a national issue now, you know, global warming and climate change is affecting the entire globe, and for that, we are strategizing. We would not like a repeat of what happened last year to occur again this year. But in whatever we do, we have to be both proactive and reactive.</p><p>“We have not acted in the way that we solved all the problems of last year, and this year has started. So we need to double you know, we’ll do some little backtracking and move in double loss to catch up with the current trends and do the needful. So all hands must be on deck NiMET, the states, NEMA and whoever has interest in environment and environmental control has to come together and work with the government in order to solve the problem.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BqZp2dpJa2rb%2BMqJ1mpZWawaq6xmaZnqynmrKvedWimp5loKeytLXDnqWtZaOdsrXAyKaYZpmemXqou8ybnGafn6uys7rOq2SepZWntKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

It also revealed that PoS terminals were launched to promote a cashless economy in the nation and aid payment in rural areas.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the growth of mobile money and PoS terminals are evidenced by ready availability as it has become the most accessible form of payment.</p><p>In a chat with The Punch, the National President, Association of Mobile Money Agents in Nigeria, <strong>Victor Olojo</strong>, confirmed charges raked in by the operators.</p><p>Olojo applauded the Pos terminal initiative spearheaded by the Central Bank, which he said has been beneficial to the agents.</p><p>Olojo said, “Agents are making a living out of this, a lot of things are happening. We have agents who have built houses, and who are earning from being an agent, it is a good initiative that is spearheaded by the Central Bank.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, many agents would not seek white collar jobs because they are earning a lot from POS business. Many are now landlords, many own properties, and many are married. We have agents who are doing very well and earning way better than bank managers.”</p><p>Speaking on the transactional costs, Olojo said it might need to be reviewed upwards of cost of service and the operating environment.</p><p>He said, “The transaction cost should increase, there is something called cost to serve, there is a challenge when it comes to serving customers, location, getting the funds available, security, a threat to life, robbery, and charges of transfer, stamp duty.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49vZpyto6m8rrHRrGSpmaliu3p%2BjGuZp2WWpL9uvM6sZK2qkaPAoq%2FToqanq12eu26%2FxK%2Bcp2WdpLu1tNJmqZ6on6fBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

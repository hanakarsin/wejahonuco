However, once other users saw what he was doing, they questioned if he was actually the real problem.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@rjones117</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A group of TikTokers made fake speed bumps in a road to get their neighbors to slow down.</h2><p>Sometimes, you can‚Äôt wait for anyone else to fix the problem. On June 1, 2023, Rjones figured just as much and started the summer by convincing his residential neighborhood to slow down.</p><p>In the 20-second video, Rjones and his friends, who may or may not work in construction, recorded themselves wearing orange vests and white hard hats.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>He began the video by giving the camera a thumbs-up and wrote on the video, ‚ÄúMaking a fake speed bump to see if people slow down.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@rjones117 href=#>@rjones117</a><p>Rjones burner <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=xyzcba href=#>#xyzcba</a> <a title=VikingRise href=#>#VikingRise</a> <a title=streetsign href=#>#streetsign</a> <a title=notforyou href=#>#notforyou</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Aces (Sped Up Version) - dkj & sped up nightcore" href=#>‚ô¨ Aces (Sped Up Version) - dkj & sped up nightcore</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>Then, Rjones and his friends put orange cones in the middle of their neighborhood‚Äôs street and added a speed bump icon to suggest that they would be building a ridge in the ground soon.</p><p>Due to being unable to build a speed bump, Rjones painted a red line in the street to act as the bump. Once the paint dried, the TikToker kept recording as he watched that ‚Äúpeople actually started to slow down.‚Äù And, sure enough, the cars riding past the street significantly slowed their cruise and drove a safer speed for a residential area.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@rjones117</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The TikTok user received mixed reviews over the legality of what he and his friends did.</h2><p>Although Rjones‚Äôs TikTok was less than one minute long, it significantly impacted those who watched it. While many commenters applauded his community service act, others, such as myself, wondered if the gesture was legal.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@rjones117</a></figure><p>The last time I checked, you couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake‚Äù a speed bump or randomly paint one piece of the street you live on. I think you have to go through your street‚Äôs officials, who would then bring on a team to take care of creating a real speed bump.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>However, I admittedly know nothing about the construction business. Nonetheless, my thoughts matched many of the comments Rjones received in his comments section.</p><p>‚ÄúBro just broke the law and posted it on Tik Tok,‚Äù one user commented.</p><p>‚ÄúYou can get fined so much for this ü§£,‚Äù another pointed out.</p><p>‚ÄúIsn't that vandalism?‚Äù a third user asked, followed by admitting, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure tho.‚Äù</p><p>While Rjones‚Äôs actions seemed illegal, it‚Äôs unclear if he received any legal ramifications after his TikTok. The video is the only one on his platform, so it doesn‚Äôt look like he updated his followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm66ssYysp56dlGKvtrnP</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

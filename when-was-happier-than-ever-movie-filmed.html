The filming dates of the corresponding movie are unknown.</p><p>As Patrick, the Academy Award-winning director in charge of the animated sequences, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Animation Magazine</a>, the crew shot about 90 minutes' worth of motion capture footage of Billie. Some scenes were filmed at the Hollywood Bowl, a true Los Angeles institution.</p><p>"Billie is a big fan of classic movies that are set in Los Angeles as well as hybrid animation/live-action classics like Richard Edmund Williams' Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Ralph Bakshi's Cool World," Patrick said.

"She has this way of moving and interacting with the camera as well as breaking the fourth wall. We only had about 12 weeks, so we had to do everything very quickly."</p><p>Asked about why she chose Los Angeles as the setting of the new movie in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>, Billie explained that it was time for her to honor her hometown and share details about the many ways it has shaped her.</p><p>"It formed me. It made me who I am. It gave me the opportunities that I got. I don't think I'd have any of the same anything if it wasn't for my hometown," Billie told GMA.

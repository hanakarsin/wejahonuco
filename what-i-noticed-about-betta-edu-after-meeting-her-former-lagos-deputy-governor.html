She later won the election and became the Party’s Women Leader.</p><p>“Betta worked very hard during the campaign. She was everywhere mobilizing women, campaiged with the Presidential Campaign team all over the country, and attended most of the events.</p><p>“We have all read about her wrongdoings and her suspension by the President and questioning by the EFCC.</p><p>“This is as it should be. I hope and pray that at the end of the day, she would have learned a hard lesson on how to conduct herself as a public officer and navigate the banana peels in the corridors of power.</p><p>“Betta Edu is like a daughter to me and I feel really sorry for her for the mess she finds herself in. I asked myself what if she’s my daughter? Would I disown her? She’s a promising bright star who could have served this nation in higher capacities.”</p><p>Speaking further, Pedro advised young Nigerians vying for office to get a mentor with some measure of credibility to guide them.</p><p>“The nation needs more young people in public service and I hope her misadventure will not discourage others in her age bracket.</p><p>“My advice to all young people who are called to service in public office is to seek out a mentor of a public officer serving or retired with some measure of credibility and good pedigree who will guide and mentor them on how to navigate the murky waters of public office,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BpZrCgkal6qnnNqKuim5WZeqKuzq6rZpqVqcGiecSdrGaZlqmys3nMnpytoZ6ceqmx0WadqKqdmr9uuMCgpqxllJq9tsDYZp6orpWnu7C%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

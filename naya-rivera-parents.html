However, the show continues to thrive through streaming services and online fans on social media. Sadly, Glee has also been trending due to some of its cast members’ real-life tragedies, including <a href=#>Naya Rivera</a>’s July 2020 drowning.</p><p>Naya’s death is one of the subjects of the ID channel’s <a href=#>documentary The Price of Glee</a>. The doc will break down Naya’s early rise to fame and how her upbringing contributed to her earning the role of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Santana Lopez</a> in the popular musical series. Here’s what to know about Naya Rivera’s parents and family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Naya Rivera’s parents? The ‘Glee’ star praised her mom on Instagram months before her death.</h2><p>Naya was born on Jan. 12, 1987, in Valencia, Santa Clarita, Calif. Her parents, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yolanda</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Rivera</a>, raised her and her two siblings — Mychal and Nickayla — in Los Angeles so Yolanda could follow her dreams of being a professional model. When Naya was a baby, Yolanda saw something in her daughter and started booking her roles at 8 months old. At one point, the mother and daughter had the same agent.</p><p>“My mom actually had moved [to Los Angeles] <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to pursue modeling</a>, and so when she had me then, she just decided that I should go ahead and try my hand at it,” Naya told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nice Girls TV</a> in 2009.</p><p>Naya’s father, George, seemingly didn’t want a career like his wife and child in the public eye. Not much is known about his job, but he currently resides in Knoxville, Tenn., per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Naya Rivera (@nayarivera)</a></p></figure><p>According to multiple reports, Yolanda and George split in 1996 after 10 years of marriage. Nonetheless, Naya had a close relationship with both of her parents and often showed her mom off on Instagram. In February 2020, Naya posted a sweet tribute to Yolanda in honor of her mom’s birthday.</p><p>“You are the epitome of beauty, the pinnacle of grace, the apple of my eye, and the most incredible woman I will ever know,” Naya wrote under an older photo of Yolanda holding her as a baby.</p><p>She added: "You are the center of the universe, a true spartan who blesses everyone you cross paths with. I love and admire you with all my heart, and with every new year around the sun, I am grateful for you.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Naya Rivera (@nayarivera)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Naya Rivera’s parents have publicly reflected on their final moments with their child.</h2><p>On July 8, 2020, Naya and <a href=#>her son, Josey</a>, went missing after she took him on a pontoon boat ride in Lake Piru, Calif. That evening, the Lake Piru’s staff found Josey sleeping on his and Naya’s rented boat, with Naya nowhere in sight.</p><p>Then, Naya’s parents, her ex and Josey’s dad <a href=#>Ryan Dorsey</a>, and more loved ones searched for her for several days. Eventually, officials found Naya’s body and pronounced her dead at age 33. Naya’s autopsy report ruled her death an accidental drowning.</p><p>In June 2021, George recalled his final conversation with his daughter on the boat that took her life. George said Naya would often “bounce ideas off of him” and showed him her and Josey’s boat on a FaceTime call.</p><p>When he realized the boat was missing an anchor, he said he had a “bad feeling that was killing me” that something would go wrong.</p><p>“I could see that the wind was blowing, and my stomach was just cringing," Naya’s father said in a People interview. "I kept telling her, 'Don't get out of the boat! Don't get out of the boat! It will drift away when you're in the water.'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Yolanda Rivera searching for Naya Rivera in July 2020.</p></figure><p>On the first anniversary of Naya’s death, her mother shared that they also spoke on the day she died.

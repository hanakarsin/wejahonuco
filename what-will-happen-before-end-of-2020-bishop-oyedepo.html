Can I tell you this? Hunger is far more devastating than any virus that will ever visit the earth,” he said.</p><p>“It kills silently. There is no vaccine for hunger. There is no medical solution to hunger. Hunger has no treatment than to have food and spiritual famine is far more devastating.”</p><p>According to the Living Faith founder, the devil’s plan was to have “spiritual famine” in the world by having churches closed. The 65-year-old Bishop, however, said the church is already waxing stronger, adding that anyone who opposes it would die.</p><p>“That is what the devil is looking for but he has failed. The church is back on its feet. Anyone who hates to see that dies for it.</p><p>“The church of Christ on the earth is liberated. Spiritual famine shall not have its way. Can I tell the world, no one has the answer to a problem like Jesus,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e5BpZrCgkal6uLXLpWShmaClsq95wZ6dqKqVYrKvsIyonWZqYGd9bq7IrJ%2BoqF2kxqawxKmmaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

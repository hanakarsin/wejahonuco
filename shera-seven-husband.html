Meet the “Sprinkle Sprinkle” lady’s husband!</h2><p>Relationship advice is best when it comes from someone who’s actually in a relationship. That’s why critics haven’t always been receptive to SheRa’s words of wisdom. But the YouTuber has made it clear that she’s speaking from experience.</p><p>SheRa is married to a man named James Scott. Per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, James graduated from the University of Maryland’s Business School in 1980. Now, he works as an SQL Developer and Integration Specialist for a tech company.</p><p>SheRa said that her husband was several years older than her when they first met. She previously opened up about the fateful encounter during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did SheRa Seven meet her husband? Details …</h2><p>SheRa and James were at a bar when they struck up a conversation. According to SheRa, James wasn’t even on her radar.</p><p>“I was sitting there sipping on whatever I was drinking,” she says in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>. “And my husband walks over to me, you know, and by this time I'm sick and tired of guys not being able to meet my standards, I'm just gonna be rude. Okay?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She continued: “First of all, I didn't want to talk to him because he wasn't my type at all. He was not my type. Ladies, that's why I say don't get hung up on looks because that could be your husband.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From the moment James sat down, he was on a shot clock … literally. She said he had two minutes to buy her a drink before she was over it. Lo and behold, he did exactly that. Still, the deal wasn’t sealed.</p><p>When he asked her out, she declined because she had work later that day. But James didn’t take no for an answer. Instead, he told her to call out. To make his offer more appealing, he reached into his pocket and gave her the money she would’ve made from work. After some serious wining and dining, the rest was history.</p><p>As SheRa would say — sprinkle sprinkle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWmvsBmqp6ulaN6qcHSm5innA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

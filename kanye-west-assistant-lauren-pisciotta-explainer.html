In her $3 million lawsuit, she claims that Kayne — whose legal name is Ye — would perform sex acts during their phone calls and send lewd text messages.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Lauren Pisciotta suing Kanye West for?</h2><p>Lauren, 35, first started working for Kanye in 2021. She was hired to help the rapper and designer with his Yeezy fashion line. She was offered the “executive assistant/personal assistant” role and given a $1 million annual salary under the condition that she would be available to him “24/7.”</p><p>In addition to helping him with his women’s clothing line, she also utilized her experience in the music industry to help him with three of his songs for his 2021 “Donda” album.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@laurenpisciotta</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Lauren is a former OnlyFans model.</h2><p>Shortly after working for him, Lauren <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that the controversial rapper wanted her to be “God-like” and asked her to delete her OnlyFans account. He offered her $1 million to do so — the same amount she claimed she earned annually as a model on the app.</p><p>In her lawsuit, which was filed Monday, Lauren alleged that Kayne would masturbate during their phone calls and ask if she knew what he was doing. She also claimed that he masturbated in front of her during a flight to Paris.</p><p>Then came the lewd text messages. One allegedly read, “See my problem is I be wanting to f--k but then after I f--k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f--ked while I'm f--king them. Then I want her to cheat on me ..."</p><p>Another lewd text allegedly described a sexual fantasy: “Is my d--k racist? It is. This f--king racist d--k of mine. I going to beat this f--king racist d--k for being f--king racist."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The text continued: "I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the s--t out of my racist d--k ... Beating the s--t out of his big black c--k."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to TMZ,</a> Kanye also fixated on the penis size of the men she dated and sent sexual photos and videos. Two of these videos reportedly showed Kanye getting intimate with a model.</p><p>This misconduct reportedly continued throughout Lauren’s time at the company.</p><p>She claims that she was promoted to the role of chief of staff, which came with a salary of $4 million. But when she was fired by Kanye in 2022, she says that he never paid out her $3 million severance package.</p><p>So far, there has been no comment from Kayne. In the past, the rapper has admitted to having a porn addiction. He claimed that it “destroyed” his family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by LP✨ (@laurenpisciotta)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @laurenpisciotta</a></figure><p>“Hollywood is a giant brothel Pornography destroyed my family I deal with the addiction instagram promotes it Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote in a viral Instagram post in 2022.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6vxcRmrp6rpGKutL%2FIrKuapqRiuaLB0Z6lZqiZqLCqu9OtmGadqKW5orXNnqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Being in love and knowing that you are truly loved is the best thing every human being wants in life. And love, some say, is synonymous with the second coming of Jesus Christ."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And love, some say, is synonymous with the second coming of Jesus Christ. It comes when you least expect it and leaves, perhaps, when you most need it.</p><p>Love is not ours to control, but we have the abilities to make it burning.</p><p>At least, if one has ever been in love, a disappointment has come a long the way.</p><p>So, ladies, how do you tell he is no longer in love with you? Men, how do you get to know you no longer have the same feeling and affection you had towards her when you first met?</p><p>Here are seven signs that will tell you are no longer in love with your girlfriend.</p><p><strong>1. Boring dates</strong></p><p>The first day you mate and the subsequent dates everything was exciting. You talked a lot, shared a lot, had mad fun together and did everything that kept the affection out of this world.</p><p>Now long gone are those days. You no longer feel the same, your dates are boring, there are deep silences at times as each of you is immersed in their phone, scrolling through the internet and feeling wasted.</p><p>Bro, you have lost interest in her.</p><p><strong>2. Simple things annoying you</strong></p><p>There are those things you found very exciting and adorable in her. For instance her voice was so charming, her laughter was enthralling, her looks were exciting and everything about her was a marvel.</p><p>These days, how she nags you, how she wants attention from you, all annoy you and make you made. You are no longer interested in her voice, you don’t care how she laughs. You have clearly lost interest in her.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Here’s why Kenyans are ending sentences with “between my legs”</p><p><strong>3. No feelings when you look at them</strong></p><p>When you are truly in love with someone, a look at home brings out the feeling of love and affection. This is exactly what you used to feel about her. She was charming and full of love. Her eyes were glowing with affection and you always wanted to be with her.</p><p>However, you no longer feel the same. Every time you look at her, you don’t feel love, you don’t feel the affection. Just tell her the truth. Don’t waste her time, bro.</p><p><strong>4. No concern when another man wants her attention</strong></p><p>Initially, you would get mad at her if another man sought her attention. Not because you were jealousy but because you so love her and wanted her to be yours and yours alone.</p><p>These days it doesn’t bother you even if you found her having coffee with another man. You care less because you want to lose her. And perhaps this is the best way to get an excuse to lose her.</p><p><strong>5. Sex</strong></p><p>The first days of your love came along with steamy sex that lasted for ages. You wanted to have her all night long, make love like grizzlies and have your own world for good. It was so intense and exciting.</p><p>But because she no longer excites you, the sex is less intense as much as the feelings are still there. You no longer get excited about it.</p><p><strong>6. You don’t listen to her anymore</strong></p><p>You really don’t care about what she says or tells you, you don’t want to know what she exactly feels; whether she is mad, excited, annoyed, why she bought a certain dress. You simply don’t want to give her the attention she wants.</p><p><strong>7. Meetings with her don’t excite you anymore</strong></p><p>Let’s say she stays in a distance. You have to take a car or plane to visit. These days you are not excited about meeting her. It doesn’t bother you anymore. You would rather spend indoors that going to meet her.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Things you should do before and after intercourse</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB9lHJuaWtdbHq0tcanqmacn6PBbrjOr5xmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWRo8auu9GeZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

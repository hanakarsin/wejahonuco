There are so many single ladies in the society who have attained that level of maturity we consider fit for marriage; yet they are wasting away in their parents’ houses or in some niche they have carved for themselves."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At this present age and time, we should be able to place the blame where it belongs and be objective when proffering solutions.</strong></p><p>There are so many single ladies in the society who have attained that level of maturity we consider fit for marriage; yet they are wasting away in their parents’ houses or in some niche they have carved for themselves.</p><p>Nigerian ladies are using technological advancement to save face; the word equity is starting to make many of them lose focus as they pledge equality towards the opposite sex and miss the opportunity to be united in holy matrimony with eligible men.</p><p>In truth, many of these ladies crave matrimonial bliss and the satisfaction that comes with knowing they are well placed in some man’s house and heart. At this point, we may have to critically review the impact of technology and modernization in the lives of our unmarried single ladies; is it a blessing or a curse? In the olden days, ladies were married off as soon as they showed signs of maturity.</p><p>Time changed yesterday; so much is being preached about rights that it would be quite difficult to take those measures used then&nbsp;for now. Find below some of the reasons why some Nigerian ladies may never get married:</p><p class=h3>1. Lack of core values</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt1e9aq51d147o.jpeg><p>Men have had enough time playing and sampling ladies outside. When many of them want to settle down, they do so because they are tired of the kind of lives they have lived and want a burst of fresh air.</p><p>It is futile getting married to women who would not make them experience any significant change in status. These women cannot cook, keep the house or add values to their lives. They feel being wild and experienced in bed is the only thing that will keep the guys going. In addition to these, their physical appearance is far from being alluring.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Amazing pre-wedding pictures you need to see</p><p class=h3>2. Living fake lives</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt69n4jfp0u4j.jpeg><p>Many Nigerian ladies that ought to have been settled in their matrimonial homes have lost the opportunity as a result of their fake lifestyles and their superficial way of doing things.</p><p>Sometimes, men just want something simple, decent and presentable; not the loud, wayward and modest-torn ladies that have plagued the cities and towns in the country. Some men get turned off when they see ladies like these; they may be good for the clubs and hotel beds, but never as graceful ornaments worthy of being placed in their houses.</p><p class=h3>3. Indecisiveness</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1tihrfq3m0f.jpeg><p>Many young ladies in the society live their lives based on influences; many of them cannot make up their minds and depend on envious friends to make important decisions for them. by the time the position of their friends dawn on them, it would have been too late and they would have missed getting connected to good and responsible men.</p><p class=h3>4. Bitterness from the past</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3bnbli0h8ni.jpeg><p>We know some of our Nigerian ladies have suffered various forms of abuse in relationships. Physical abuse, as well as verbal bashing, has made some women embittered towards the institution of marriage. Although this could be a traumatic experience for many of these women, they allow the pain to drag on for too long and refuse to get up from that point.</p><p class=h3>5. When they are wild</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3s6q1h08bj3.jpeg><p>Many Nigerian ladies are found wanting in this aspect; they present everything to a man as soon as they start dating. Come on, it is just a relationship, not a marriage, and you have already given him the cookie. Basically, he has nothing to look forward to again when it comes to living with you forever.</p><p>Some ladies do not just give out the cookie, they end up giving the men the cookie container too and are willing to allow the men bend and hit the container as much as possible while lustfully dazed.</p><p class=h3>6. Living on pastors’ prophecies</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5fha0dvd57e.jpeg><p>Welcome to Nigeria, a country where people heed the warning of the pastors and prophecies as compared to the things they see in their holy books. Some Nigerian ladies have fallen victims of this situation and have learnt the hard way.</p><p>Many of them would turn down the marriage proposals of responsible men because their pastors have seen the future which has doom in it. What union does not have dark clouds that give way to heavy rainstorm?</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;12 things you will know if you eat from eateries in Nigeria</p><p class=h3>7. When they intimidate men</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1maq7nfes568.jpeg><p>There is no doubt we have lots of intelligent women in the society; women are starting to climb the financial and economic ladder in the society and have gained recognition for the various roles they have been playing towards the development of the country.</p><p>But when a woman allows the fame and successes she has recorded in her name to get to her head, she is most likely to miss out on this important part of her life. Men do not like being intimidated; men who cannot handle success in their partners will never opt in for women like that.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXaDl21uZm9dqbyxedGemKynnqh6r7XGnqmimZ5iuaKwyJ6qZqWRrnqvsdWeqWaflal6rq3Rq6CenF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The whole world is facing crisis and inflation. America is going under the worst inflation in the last 40 years, likewise Ghana, Niger, and our neighbouring countries.</p><p>“We have to appreciate what is going on in the world before we unnecessarily criticise an issue that is global. The issues we have are beyond what one country can solve.</p><p>“I consider this as a passing phase in our development journey. Countries that are over 400 years old are still facing some crisis. When did the Irish and British overcome theirs? See, we have history to learn and borrow from and we should pray for our leaders to do what is right. But all of us should know that we have a role and contribution to make.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BxZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmp6SdsrN5z6umm6SVosBuw86nq2arpKS9bq3PnGSfqp%2Bieri1zaegp59dZ31zf4yeo56bpJ68r7%2BMppismaKefA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

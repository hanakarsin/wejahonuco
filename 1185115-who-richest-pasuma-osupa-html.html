This part of the country is occupied by the Yoruba people, that is why Pasuma’s music in Yoruba language is so appreciated here. The musician started his career in 1984, and since then he became one of the most famous and wealthiest Fuji musicians in Nigeria.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c4b4c5f725d0bdf2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is youngest billionaire in Nigeria in 2018?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c4b4c5f725d0bdf2.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite the fact that Pasuma is called the King of Fuji music he is not the richest Fuji musician in Nigeria. The wealthiest Fuji musician is Ayinde Wasiu Marshal with the net worth about N750 million. So, how much did Pasuma managed to earn? Wasiu Alabi Pasuma is a very talented and productive musician, he releases about five albums each year.</p><p class=align-left>The estimated net worth of Pasuma Wonder is N455 million so far. Besides this, he has a lot of investments including real estate. Pasuma owns a mansion in Omole, and it is believed that the musician paid N60 million for the house. There were also rumors that Pasuma has acquired a house in Magodo, but there are no photos of this mansion, and there was no confirmation of these rumors by the musician himself. The musician is also an owner of such expensive vehicles as Range Rover jeep and Toyota Highlander SUV.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3oi9badefqd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wasiu Alabi Pasuma’s biography: age, net worth, house, children</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt19ob9dn0b84g.jpg><h3>Osupa's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Saheed Osupa born as Akorede Babatunde Okunola is not just a famous musician who performs in Fuji genre but also an actor, who acted in more than 30 Yoruba movies.

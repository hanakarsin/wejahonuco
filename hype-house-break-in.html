He called the situation weird and expressed his disbelief that folks thought it was OK.</p><p>Where did Chase get the basis for his allegations? Well, the folks involved with the break-in recorded themselves inside the home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The mom, her daughter and the young girl's friends are denying the Hype House break-in.</h2><p>In a now-deleted <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, Maria Ulacia said, "I just wanted to come on here to apologize to everybody who unfortunately believes that I broke into the Hype House." She went on to add that she didn't lift anything from the home and that yes, she did put on Chase Hudson's jacket, but she didn't steal it. "I am not a thief, never have been and never will be," she said.</p><p>So how did Maria, her daughter, and their friends get inside the house and record videos that they then uploaded online? Maria says that there was a caretaker in the home who let them inside.</p><p>The woman's daughter, Jenny Popach, also reiterated that a caretaker led them to "believe it was OK to see the home."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | @The Hype House</span></figure><p>Jenny went on to say that the front door was unlocked and that a hat her friend was wearing didn't belong to Influencer <a href=#>Avani Gregg</a>. She also denied flushing a fish down a toilet and stealing a pet gecko.</p><p>Alex Warren, another member of the TikTok collective, said that this simply isn't the case. "We don't have caretakers at the old Hype House. Every door was locked except one window," he wrote on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan's post</a> about the story.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mother that broke into <a href=#>@xlilhuddy</a> ‚Äòs old Hype House.

Even though they were in a new home, they were still paying rent on the previous Hype House.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The initial series of videos showing the "break-in" have all since been deleted, but reports indicate that a woman who appeared to be one of the young girls' moms, presumably Maria, said that they were going to move into the "OG Hype House" and they'd be launching the "Junior Hype House."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>sis planned the hype house break in since early January <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/btipjcxHQl</a></p>‚Äî Ÿã pinned (@SASH00N) <a href=#>June 13, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @SASH00N</span></figure><p>"So, if you want, stay tuned.

They also danced around in the Hype House bathroom.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So... kinda hoping those people who broke into the hype house today get arrested like.. they are out here claiming they didn‚Äôt break in or take anything but magically things are missing.. things aren‚Äôt adding up.</p>‚Äî SARAHüíô (@Sarahisfallin) <a href=#>June 13, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @Sarahisfallin</span></figure><p>It isn't uncommon for influencers to band together and live in a shared house in the hopes of upping one another's respective brands. The more popular they become, however, the more people are going to know about the homes that they live in and try and check out the spots for themselves.</p><p>Anthony Reeves at the <a href=#>Sway House</a>, for example, has urged folks on social media many times not to drop in whenever they felt like it to knock on the front door or peer through the window.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncaxsYyhpq6rlWKvs7HApGSipg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

 The specter of Donald Trump was haunting the Miss USA pageant this year, though the presidential hopeful had nothing to do with the pageant for once. After NBC refused to air the show last year, following Trump's racist remarks about Hispanics, Trump sued the broadcasting company."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After NBC refused to air the show last year, following Trump's racist remarks about Hispanics, Trump sued the broadcasting company. He settled in September, and the show is now run by&nbsp;talent management company WME/IMG.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;BUT THERE'S NO ESCAPE. Even without Trump heavy breathing in the wings, his name came up, and it was unfortunately the burden of runner up winner Miss Hawaii to deal with it. It's a shame, she looks like she was having so much fun before:&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Miss Hawaii USA is having a ball of a time backstage at #MissUSA's 2016 prelims.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by Deshauna Barber (@missusa) on Jun 1, 2016 at 7:32pm PDT</p></figure><p>&nbsp;When it was time for the interview portion of the evening, Miss Hawaii was asked, "If the election were held tomorrow, would you vote Hilary Clinton or Donald Trump for president, and why would you choose one over the other?" Oh my god.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>&nbsp;To her credit, Miss Hawaii managed a coherent response that didn't end with her announcing her political affiliation, saying, "It doesn't matter&nbsp;what gender, what we need in the United States is someone who represents those of us who don't feel like we have a voice, those of us who want our voices heard. We need a president to push for what is right, and push for what America really needs."&nbsp;</p><p>That response kind of makes me think she actually is a Trump supporter? But most viewers were on her side no matter what, because that question was RUDE:&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That was the worst question to give to a contestant and <a href=#>#MissHawaii</a> handled that professionally and the best way possible. <a href=#>#MissUSA</a></p>— Ashley Alexiss (@AshAlexiss) <a href=#>June 6, 2016</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I want to apologize on behalf of all Americans for putting <a href=#>#MissHawaii</a> though that question.

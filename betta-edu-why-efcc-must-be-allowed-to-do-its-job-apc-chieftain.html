Like the popular saying, evil communication corrupts good manners.</p><p>“Nigerians should not turn themselves to judges, allow EFCC to do their job, and leave Tinubu alone to concentrate on delivery dividends of democracy to Nigerians.</p><p>“We should be calm and continue to work together as a nation to enable good governance and also encourage the president to discharge any rot from the government.</p><p>“Nigerians should understand that corruption is more like a regalia that will always want to remain after many washings, but it will only take a while to get rid of the rotten elements in the system.</p><p>“We are aware that our country Nigeria has been recycling corrupt systems for decades without pretending, but with the support of the citizens, better days will surely come.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FqZpudpKmubrHDrmSwoKlisqevwmakrqukYq%2BmecClo6ivlZl6tbuMnaZmoaSoequ7wWaYqZtdmLWqscWtmKKmXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Another assault on the village of Dzur on Saturday morning left at least eight people dead.&nbsp;Three other attacks in Michika local government area, Adamawa State, on Saturday killed dozens of people, witnesses and a local politician report to the Reuters and CNN news agencies.&nbsp;The unidentified hoodlums suspected to be members of Boko Haram terrorist cell also have kidnapped a number of villagers.</p><p>As security sources confirm the attack, the government doubts if the&nbsp;attacks really were carried out by Boko Haram. The authorities indicate that it could have been&nbsp;one of several criminal groups that are exploiting the chaos of the insurgency. According to&nbsp;government spokesman Mike Omeri, who was interviewed by Reuters, Boko Haram representatives also deny involvement in the attacks.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHGDmG5wZpqfoLxutMCrmKZlkaG5prPEnaOyZaaevK2t056qZpuVlsCmssirnGaZl6eyprnEp6tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

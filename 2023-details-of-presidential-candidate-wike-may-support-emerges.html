There are three major presidential candidates in the election. They have completely ruled out Atiku of PDP. Atiku’s campaign team even boasted that they can win the election without the support of the integrity governors. Don’t forget, Atiku also ignored Seyi Makinde and announced Ademola Adeleke as the Chairman of the South-West Coordinating Committee of the campaign council.</p><p>”With Atiku out of the picture, the two remaining candidates are Asiwaju and the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi. From the look of things, a highly sophisticated politician like Wike can never support Obi who has no structures but only relying on social media and fake online polls to claim victory”.</p><p>”Politics as they say is a game of numbers. With the flop witnessed in Kogi, Osun and Port Harcourt rally of Labour Party and other parts of the country, do you think any serious politician will support him”? he asked.</p><p>Similarly, another APC chieftain who is a member of the South-West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 (SWAGA’23) said the body language of the G5 governors shows they are in support of Tinubu’s aspiration.</p><p>The source said;&nbsp;” From the body language of the governors, it is clear they are supporting Asiwaju. If you remember, the Oyo State Governor Makinde said they are in support of the Pa Reuben Fasoranti-led Afenifere which endorsed Tinubu’s presidential bid”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FvZmtoYmh6pbHTmqClq12ks2680Z6qopyVo8GqrctmmpqmlJ6xosDEZq6io5ViuqLFjKysqaifp8FuscyeqaCdo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: Epic GamesWhether you’re just a casual Fortnite player or you sink dozens of hours into the popular battle royale game every week, there’s always more to learn about Epic Games’ crown jewel. Obviously, every time Epic rolls out a new Season or Chapter of Fortnite, everyone is on a pretty level playing field when it comes to finding new vehicles, hidden objects, or important characters (some of us may still be looking for Snowmando…)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Obviously, every time Epic rolls out a new Season or Chapter of Fortnite, everyone is on a pretty level playing field when it comes to finding new vehicles, hidden objects, or important characters (some of us may still be looking for Snowmando…).</p><p>Even the most seasoned Fortnite player has to Google things sometimes, which is why we weren’t surprised to see a ton of people wondering: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What does “outlast opponents” mean</a>? The answer is actually pretty straightforward, but we’re pleased to help you out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What does “outlast opponents” mean in ‘Fortnite’?</h2><p>The Black Panther <a href=#>Wakanda Forever Challenges</a> were recently rolled out in the game, and players need to complete all three of them in order to unlock the Wakanda Salute emote. The challenges are surprisingly straightforward:</p><ul><li>Play 10 Matches</li><li>Outlast 500 Opponents</li><li>Play Five Duo or Squad Matches</li></ul><p>The first and third challenges are self-explanatory, but some people struggled to understand what exactly was meant by “Outlast 500 Opponents.”</p><p>In short, outlasting an opponent in Fortnite just means that you survive in the game longer than they do. If you win a battle royale game against 99 other players, congrats! You’ve just outlasted all 99 of ‘em!&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you’re keeping up with the math, you’re going to need to play a few matches in order to outlast 500 of your fellow Fortnite players. Like, at least six of them if you’re really, really good at Fortnite. Most people will probably need to play quite a few more matches in order to complete that challenge. On the bright side, though, that will put you well on your way to completing Challenge No. 1 (Play 10 Matches).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wakanda Salute emote showcase! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XhhEwTy6Gu</a></p>— FNBRBananik • Fortnite Leaks & News (@FNBRBananik) <a href=#>December 21, 2020</a></figure><p>Once you’ve completed all three requirements of the Black Panther Wakanda Forever Challenge, the Wakanda Salute emote will automatically be added to your collection. You only have until Jan. 12, 2021, at 7 p.m. ET to complete the challenges, so don’t wait too long to get started on your quest!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">You can also get the Black Panther skin.</h2><p>Epic has also released a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Panther skin</a> as part of its tribute to the Marvel character. Unfortunately, it can’t be earned simply by playing the game — you’re gonna have to shell out actual money for it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fortnite did a nice tribute to Chadwick Boseman's character the black panther <a href=#>#WakandaForever</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QjulXp5vYB</a></p>— 🎄Festive Casper🎅🏻 (@CasperReverse) <a href=#>December 21, 2020</a></figure><p>The Black Panther skin is part of The Marvel Royalty and Warriors Pack, which will set you back $25. Actually, there are three Marvel characters represented in the bundle. For Black Panther, you get the outfit, a vibranium daggers dual pickaxe, the Wakandan Skyrider glider, and King Cowl’s back bling. You’ll also receive an outfit, pickaxe, glider, and back bling for Captain Marvel and everything but a glider for Taskmaster. Not a bad deal (although “free” is always our preferred price)!</p><p>Here’s hoping you’re able to outlast all of your opponents in your upcoming Fortnite games (or at least a bunch of them, anyway). Even if you aren’t, you at least know what it means to outlast them now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaTCtbjArKtmp6ClvK%2Bxza2qZqWVlrtutc1mnaiqpKO2tbE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

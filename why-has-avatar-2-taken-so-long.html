Source: 20th Century StudiosIt's been quite a while since anyone's talked about Avatar. The 2009 film is mostly remembered as &#34;the blue alien movie with the weird hair stuff that your dad knows really well,&#34; but it's easy to forget how successful the film was back in its day."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 2009 film is mostly remembered as "the blue alien movie with the weird hair stuff that your dad knows really well," but it's easy to forget how successful the film was back in its day. In fact, the movie even re-took the record for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest grossing film in history</a>, snatching the title back from Avengers: Endgame last year. A sequel was greenlit almost immediately, but we're finally getting our first glimpse of Avatar 2 in 2022.</p><p>The original Avatar follows an Airbender named Aang who — wait, wrong <a href=#>Avatar</a>. The James Cameron film follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a man who uses an alien avatar to interact with the indigenous alien species of the Na'vi. When the U.S. military tries to deplete their planet of its natural resources, Jake takes a stand with the Na'vi to protect his new home.</p><p>The sequel has been a long time coming, and there are even more Avatar films down the pipeline. But why did it take so long for a second one to be made?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: 20th Century Studios</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why has 'Avatar 2' taken so long?</h2><p>The highest-grossing film of all time was bound to earn a sequel or two. Avatar 2 was officially confirmed all the way back in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2010</a>, with at least <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three more films announced</a> in the following years.</p><p>Avatar 2 was originally scheduled to be released in 2014, but obviously, that never materialized. In fact, Avatar 2 was <a href=#>delayed</a> several times throughout its production. Why did the film take over 13 years to finally produce?</p><p>In 2015, James Cameron suggested that the scripts and the creature designs were taking longer than expected. After all, he was working on all of the Avatar sequels at once at the time.</p><p>"There's a layer of complexity in getting the story to work as a saga across three films that you don't get when you're making a stand-alone film," James told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "We're writing three simultaneously. And we've done that so everything tracks throughout the three films."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Footage from 'Avatar: The Way of Water' shown at CinemaCon 2022</p></figure><p>In 2021, James once again spoke up about the film's constant delays. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> that Avatar 2 takes place primarily underwater. From that, we can surmise that having to animate water segments throughout the film using Avatar's groundbreaking computer animation padded production time even more.</p><p>However, at long last, the sequel is officially on the horizon. And it only took 13 years and one global pandemic!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Avatar 2' officially has a title and its release date is coming.</h2><p>In April 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">substantial info</a> on Avatar 2 was finally unveiled. The film is officially called Avatar: The Way of Water. Complete with a snazzy new logo that's decidedly not Papyrus font, Disney shared brand new footage for the sequel for CinemaCon 2022 attendees.</p><p>The first official trailer for the film will be attached to the premiere of <a href=#>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>, which hits theaters on May 6.</p><p>Avatar: The Way of Water will be released theatrically on Dec. 16, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6eceaqmaZppbBor6Ma2StmZuau26%2FzmajqKaX</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

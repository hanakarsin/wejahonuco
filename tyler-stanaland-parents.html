Tyler's father, John Stanaland, operates the Orange County-based brokerage the John Stanaland Group.</p><p>The reality star's parents are divorced, and his mother, Lisa Cameron, co-owns an interior design studio called The Modern Vault.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tyler's brother, Trevor Stanaland, and his stepmother, Rachel Stanaland, are also agents at the John Stanaland Group.</p><p>The Selling the OC star's family has long been involved in real estate. According to his bio on the John Stanaland Group <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, John "is the fifth generation of real estate professionals in his family."</p><p>The Stanaland family also has deep roots in Orange County.</p><p>During his chat with Distractify, Tyler talked about his personal connection to Orange County — and why people continue to gravitate to the area.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm born and raised in Laguna Beach. But I think Orange County specifically just has a different culture and a different feel — [it has] different scenery, and a different community than LA. It really is kind of Heaven on Earth, which I think attracts viewers and makes people want to live there," he said. "I'm fourth generation Orange County, so people come and they stay."</p><p>Tyler went on to say that it wasn't an easy decision to decide to leave his dad's brokerage in order to join the O Group and, therefore to appear on the Netflix reality series.</p><p>"It's a big step to leave that safety net of the family business regardless, and then to do it, in front of the whole world is even more challenging," Tyler said about leaving the John Stanaland Group. "Luckily, I have a very supportive family, who taught me everything I know."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The timing proved to be serendipitous, as Tyler made the decision to leave as Jason was opening the Orange County office.</p><p>"I think, as a young prideful man, there comes a point when you want to kind of carve your own path, and this just kind of felt like the right time. Not only [was it] the right time, but couple that with Jason bringing his brand to Orange County, it just seemed like it was meant to be," he added. "I took the leap of faith, and I guess we'll see how it goes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'Selling the OC' star believes he made the "right call" by joining the Oppenheim Group.</h2><p>Arguments, disagreements, and full-fledged feuds are prerequisites on real estate reality programs like Selling Sunset, Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, and, now, Selling the OC.</p><p>Since Tyler has described himself as more "reserved," did he ever wish he stayed at the family business instead of leaving it behind for a desk at the O Group's Orange County office?</p><p>"I wasn't regretful, because I think that the drama that I got sucked into was different from my business," he told Distractify. "From a business standpoint, it was the right call, and the drama was just something that, unfortunately, happened."</p><p>He also said that, though it was "challenging" to relax around the cameras, he stayed true to himself throughout filming.</p><p>You can find out more about Tyler's experience on the show by tuning in to the eight-episode first season.</p><p>The debut season of Selling the OC will drop on Netflix on Aug. 24 at 3 a.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqcatsdFmqq2Znpa5orrDZqeaqpWjwbQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

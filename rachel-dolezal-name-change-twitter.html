Dolezal is the former leader of the Spokane National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) who ignited a firestorm in 2015 when it was revealed that she was white, and had been passing herself off as African American for years. Despite wearing her hair in "natural" styles many black women wear and boasting a graduate degree from Howard University, an historically black university, she was "outed" as white by her estranged family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Following the revelation, she resigned from the NAACP. Allegedly, she still hasn't been able to find another job, even a minimum-wage one. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> recently that she expected to be homeless within a month.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>Now, she's making headlines, yet again. It emerged from court documents yesterday that Doleza has legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, a name with African origins.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>If that wasn't enough, NY Times best-selling author Luvvie Ajayi, who has been an outspoken critic of Dolezal, claims to have recently got an email from one of Dolezal's former coworkers. It details exactly how Dolezal attempted to deceive them all, and all the antics she got up to. It's well worth a read.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y'all.

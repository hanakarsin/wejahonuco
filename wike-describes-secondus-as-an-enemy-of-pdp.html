And it is not fair”</p><p>“This is a party that has given you everything and there’s nothing wrong in making sacrifice. Even if, assuming though not conceding, that anything was wrong, we expected that having achieved what you have achieved in your life from this party, there is nothing wrong in making sacrifice.</p><p>“If you make sacrifice for the party, you’re making sacrifice for Nigerians. If PDP is not there, which other party is ready to rescue Nigeria?”</p><p>The Rivers State Governor added that the Court of Appeal did not only dismiss the application of Secondus, but also ordered that the PDP National convention be conducted unrestrained.</p><p>“Our constitution provides that if a national chairman is removed, the deputy national chairman from that zone will immediately be the chairman or acting chairman as the case may be.</p><p>“And so, when Secondus was removed, he handed over to the acting national chairman now. So, the act has already been done, completed. So, what will the court say when someone is already acting and supervising that office.”</p><p>He asserted that Nigerians are expecting PDP to come out of the convention more united.</p><p>“Nigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us, collectively and see how this country can be rescued.</p><p>“Nigerians are not happy with the ruling party, the way Nigerians are being treated. Like I’ve told everybody that there is nothing better than making sacrifice for the interest of the country.</p><p>“PDP is the only platform, and which it is today as the only opposition party that will rescue Nigeria,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FyZrChm5p6pbHSnKmimpWoerSxwqilna2jYq60ecCnZJ6mlaLGbrvFZqedqF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

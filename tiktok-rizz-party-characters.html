We should not know about the Rizz Party on <a href=#>TikTok</a>. We shouldn‚Äôt know what a Rizz Party is. We should not be watching any footage of any collection of teenage boys singing along to rap songs. But the TikTok algorithm deems it important, and here we are.</p><p>If you‚Äôre like most people, you have no idea what a TikTok Rizz Party is, or was, or might be. There‚Äôs a reason we wrote an <a href=#>explainer</a> about it when it first trended in August 2023, and there‚Äôs a reason we wrote an explainer on the <a href=#>TikTok Rizz Party</a> again on April 4, 2024 when it went viral again thanks to a group of kids rapping along to Kanye West‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarnival.‚Äù But now it‚Äôs growing. God help us, it‚Äôs growing.</p><p>And because you can always rely on the internet to take things too far, TikTokers all over the globe have fixated on the young boys of the Rizz Party video, turning them into characters. Here's what we mean.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">17 seconds of footage has resulted in a slurry of TikTok Rizz Party reaction videos, analyses, and more.</h2><p>In case you still have no idea what we‚Äôre talking about, you may first want to watch the <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">entirely innocent video</a>. As we mentioned, the boys in the video are becoming characters, and the internet can't get enough.</p><p>Because we still don't know many of their names, people are giving them nicknames based on their briefly-seen characteristics, like "Broccoli-Hair Kid" and "Group Leader." And not only are people ranking, rating, and analyzing them, they're also giving them deep fan lore ‚Äî because of course they are.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@semden420 href=#>@semden420</a><p>Which TikTok Rizz Party Member is ur Favorite?

This one just puts a Mitski song over it, making the video much more pleasant. This TikTok would absolutely work in a coming-of-age film about how cruel and fickle both teenagers and social media can be.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>One of the most popular TikTok Rizz Party related TikToks is by @foundfootagefilm. It's a teaser TikTok for a 7 minute, 20 second interview with two of the kids on YouTube. The interviewer has them watch the TikToks inspired by the original. One of the kids says, "Dedicating their time to make that video, I would say, like, if I saw that on my page I would start laughing but like, dedicating your time to that, like, you're just making fun of a 15-year-old trying to have fun."</p><p>We should point out that none of the boys becoming infamous from this video actually posted the TikTok. Island Entertainment is responsible for 17 seconds of footage that has thus far resulted in 57.2 million views and counting. Here‚Äôs hoping at least one of the kids makes any sort of money from this. And here‚Äôs hoping the TikTok algorithm stops pushing videos of children rapping along to Kanye at a sweet 16 birthday party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6kZKuhqq96sa3RrbBmm5iWv6Kv056prA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

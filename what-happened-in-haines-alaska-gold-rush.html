The ‘Gold Rush’ crew returns after a devastating tragedy.</h2><p>Louisiana has hurricanes, California has wildfires, and in Alaska, residents are forced to endure fatal landslides — one of which occurred in early December of 2020 and devastated the city of Haines. The slide, which was estimated to be about 600 feet wide, occurred on Dec. 20 with reports that record-breaking rainfall destroyed at least nine homes. Two residents were found dead in the aftermath of the winter storm, which many are still recovering from it today.</p><p>Only months before the landslide, the Gold Rush crew returned to Haines to film Season 11, where the miners got real about the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on their line of work. Little did they know they would be returning to the small town much sooner than expected.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#GoldRush</a> episode tonight was filmed right after the <a href=#>#Haines</a> landslide this last year. 💔</p>— Krazy Thee Alaskan (@gomer2323) <a href=#>August 14, 2021</a></figure><p>In Gold Rush: Winter’s Fortune, cameras follow Dustin Hurt and the rest of the Gold Rush crew during the off-season. Among the guys, Dustin has the most to lose after the landslides, and in the upcoming spinoff, he travels to Haines, Alaska to determine how much of his camp can be salvaged.</p><p>In addition, cameras will also document the adventures of Rick Ness, <a href=#>Tony Beets</a>, Dave Turin, and Fred Lewis. But <a href=#>where is Parker Schnabel on Gold Rush: Winter Fortune</a>? Did he leave the show?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Parker on ‘Gold Rush’?</h2><p>There is no indication that Parker’s days of mining on Gold Rush have come to an end just yet, although he’s rarely made appearances in the spinoff. Parker’s former foreman Rick teased that while he’s “no Parker Schnabel,” viewers will have plenty to look forward to in Winter’s Fortune.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I can only speak for my guys and me, but it’s a bit of planning for the coming season for us. And it’s also a bit of blowing off steam because I think you can tell that we also like to have fun,” Rick told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idaho Press</a>, “We don’t have a whole lot of time for it during the mining season. So we got to fit a lot of that in the off-season.”</p><p>So far, showrunners haven’t announced a release date for Season 12, but in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, Rick confirmed it's on the way.</p><p>You can watch new episodes of Gold Rush: Winter Fortune Fridays on the Discovery Channel at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnIp2ShmZmjsrR5wKWYrKORYrSwuMNmqa6rmA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

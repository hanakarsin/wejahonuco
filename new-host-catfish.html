"But, I am just delighted every day that I get to spend with Kamie. With every episode that we get to film together, it just further confirms the choice that we made."</p><p>The DWTS alum added that he has become close friends with Kamie, and that she is "just so fantastic at her job" as an internet sleuth on Catfish.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"What she brings to the show in terms of personality and knowledge and references — it's just so invaluable," he said, before noting that Kamie's younger age allows her to connect with the people who write in as well.</p><p>"She's so intuitive.

Source: CBSIt’s time we stop comparing Big Brother contestant Jack Matthews to Jason Momoa. If you don’t watch the show’s 24/7 live feeds, you may be wondering what happened with the fitness trainer, who is now being called a racist by fans.
Despite his limited interactions with Kemi Fakunle, one of only two black competitors in the house, Jack’s vitriol toward the marketing strategist has continued to ramp up, causing some viewers to speculate whether he’s targeting the 25-year-old because of her race."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Though former contestant Sam Bledsoe originally said that line in Season 20, fans are finding Jack’s aggressive behavior disturbing.&nbsp;</p><p>In another instance, the CrossFit junkie was overhead saying, "It’s like, b---h you’re f--king going up and you can play for your veto, but I’m gonna f--k you up." He continued, "God, dude, she gets me so hyped! I f--king hate…" but the CBS feed cut away before he finished his sentence.</p><p>Kemi isn’t the only cast member Jack has been picking on. When talking about Latina plus-sized model Jessica Milagros, he stated, "I flirt with her just to make her feel good about herself." He’s also referred to her as "Consuela" in conversations with other houseguests.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second time this season that a Big Brother contestant has been <a href=#>accused of racism</a>. Jackson Michie received backlash for choosing to banish Jessica, Kemi, David Alexander (who’s also black), and Cliff Hogg III (the oldest competitor in the house) during the first round of eliminations.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Viewers started a petition to get rid of Jack Matthews.</h2><p>One concerned fan created a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> in an effort to convince CBS to remove the Tampa resident from the show.&nbsp;"Jack Matthews has said numerous racist things and has been very aggressive towards the only black woman in the Big Brother house," the description reads. "He needs to be expelled for Kemi’s safety and to show that it’s not okay to be racist in 2019, especially on TV."</p><p>The petition currently has over 1,700 signatures. One supporter wrote, "As a black woman in America and more importantly in Florida where Jack lives, he shouldn't be allowed to be on TV and have a chance to win this game when he can't leave his dislike for someone IN. THE. GAME. strictly gameplay."</p><p>The individual added, "This is personal. He will harm her, in the house or after. He needs to be far away from her and get help. Desperately."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Jack be ejected from the Big Brother house?</h2><p>That remains to be seen, though Jack seemed to suggest that producers warned him about his remarks. "They're taking it out of context. I just need to be careful what I say," the photography enthusiast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly said</a> on a recent live feed.</p><p>Contestant Tommy Bracco responded, "Someone must have told them (production) that they were uncomfortable?" to which Jack clarified, "They saw. It's not a big deal. It was production."</p><p>Ironically, in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-show interview</a>, Jack stated that his strategy for winning the game is to "Be honest, have integrity, and good character." You failed big time, buddy.</p><p>Watch new episodes of Big Brother three days a week on CBS and catch the 24/7 live feeds on CBS All Access.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBop5mmqKkwamx0WahmpubYrqiwNOhnLCr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

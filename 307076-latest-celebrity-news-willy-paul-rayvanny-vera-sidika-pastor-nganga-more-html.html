From Sonko hitting the headlines again over a nasty remark he made about Esther Passaris, Ng'ang'a abusing his bishops ‘lubbish’ to Vera Sidika telling her fans why size doesn’t matter, nothing could cool down the latest celeb news in the country. Here is a recap of the biggest stories that were trending this week.</p><h2>1. Sonko blasts Esther Passaris in his Madaraka Day speech</h2><p class=align-left>Sonko made the headlines of the Kenya celeb news after he made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nasty remarks </a>directed at Hon. Esther Passaris during Madaraka Day celebrations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/463824c1119fed23.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news in Kenya: Ruth Matete, Vanessa Mdee, Magix Enga, Rayvanny</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Nairobi Women representative had earlier criticized Sonko’s humanitarian efforts in providing food to the less fortunate. She also said that the Governor rarely picks her calls.</p><p class=align-left>In response, Sonko went ham on her. He “advised” her to take the little she has to children’s home.</p>Wewe hiyo pesa yako unasema ni kidogo peleka kwa children’s home. Mimi ile yangu mingi wacha nipelekee wanainchi… Kawangware, Kayole, Korogocho Komarock and Kibera, he said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/463824c1119fed23.jpeg><p class=align-left>The crowd that had attended the Pumwani Madaraka Day celebrations cheered on the Nairobi boss as he made his speech.</p>And the issue of you complaining that I am not picking your calls, know that I will pick them when I am free. If I am in a meeting like this one, I cannot pick calls, he added.<p class=align-left>The Nairobi Governor then defended his words by explaining that he was not arguing with her but rather answering her queries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/96180a485304f9bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Joyce Omondi, Kathy Kiuna, Timmy T Dat & More</span></p></a>I am responding to her. We are not arguing. At times we have to disagree to agree. There are times I call Rais, and he doesn’t pick, and I don’t complain. I understand that he is a busy man. Kwa hivyo mimi sio bwana yako nitashika simu saa ile unataka, Sonko said.<p class=align-left>Passaris was annoyed by the cheering crowd and Sonko’s comments. She walked out of the event while Sonko was still addressing the issue. The crowd jeered at her as she was leaving.</p><p class=align-left>Sonko then shouted at her:</p>Haya kwaheri. Kwaheri ya kuonana.<p class=align-left>The Nairobi County boss had graced the occasion dressed like a Commander in Chief of the City Council policemen.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left>Earlier this week Passaris had taken to Twitter to complain about how the Nairobi senator, Sakaja and Raila Odinga had excluded her on their lunch date.

Vera Sidika shares insights with fans on why size doesn’t matter in bed</h2><p class=align-left>Kenyan socialite and businesswoman Vera Sidika answered the question, “Does size matter when it comes to intimacy” that one of his fans fired at her on Instagram.</p><p class=align-left>According to Vera, size is very relative and that it is a nice thing for a woman to land on a man with good size. For men with small sizes, she said that what matters is the skills they employ when eating cakes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b717d58661a0c105.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz, Size 8, Otile Brown, Ann Kansiime & more</span></p></a>Does size matter in bed?. One of her fans asked.<p class=align-left>In response the entrepreneur said:</p>Not really, nut what you do with the little you have, oops. But if you don’t know how to use it at least have a good size so the chic can use it on herself well well when you are slacking. Small size and no skill is a nightmare.<p class=align-left>Rumours have it that Vera Sidika and Otile Brown parted ways because the singer bed game was low. The issue attracted a lot of comments and reactions last year as many of her fans wanted to know whether her ex-boyfriend was endowed.</p><p class=align-left>Vera also confirmed that she wasn’t dating former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo’s son saying that they were “just new friends” in the answer-question section.</p>No. never dated — just new friends. We just recently met btw. Had never met him before, she revealed.<p class=align-left>A few weeks ago Vera Sidika hit the headlines after she rejected producer Jegede’s proposal saying that she doesn’t know him and that he was using her name to build his brand.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ac41b1454376e9ab.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Willy Paul, Erick Omondi, Nzula Makosi and more</span></p></a><h2>3. Willy Paul accuses Rayvanny of stealing his song</h2><p class=align-left>Self-proclaimed ‘gospel’ artist Willy Paul erupted his anger to WCB’s Rayvanny after he allegedly stole his song.</p><p class=align-left>In a video that is making rounds on all the social media platforms, the Jigijigi singer is seen castigating the Tanzanian singer for robbing his song after their collabo hit the rock.</p><p class=align-left>According to the president of the Saldido records, the hit is dubbed “Chuchuma”, and he recorded it sometimes back before reaching out to Rayvanny for a collabo which didn’t work out.</p>I would like to bring this to everybody’s attention that there is some artiste somewhere anajaribu kuniibia,anajaribu kumuibia mkenya na all along wakenya wameusupport sana muziki wao. Nimepata support kutoka kwa country yao pia but it’s so sad kuona mtu anajaribu kuniibia just because callabo haikuwaork out, mtu ananiibia idea yangu it’s so painful, he said.<p class=align-left>Pozee criticized the Tanzanian singer telling him that he wouldn’t get away with it as nobody steals from him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/01c90a777b3f5695.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz, Nyce Wanjeri tape, Chameleone and more</span></p></a>You cannot do that to a brother. You cannot steal and get away with it. And my friend listen. Nobody steals from Pozee, Willy Paul said.<p class=align-left>These allegations came an hour after Rayvanny uploaded a new version of the “Chuchuma” track on IG to alert his fans to get ready as he was going to release the song soon.</p><p class=align-left>After listening to the songs, one can determine that there is truly a striking resemblance in the rhythm and also the way beats have been ordered.</p><p class=align-left>This striking resemblance has raised fans’ eyebrows eliciting a discussion of whether the Tanzanian WCB member stole from Pozee or just got some ideas that were still in existence.</p><p class=align-left>This is not the first time Rayvanny is being accused of stealing a song from a fellow artist. A few months ago he had been on the spot for directly copying a dancing scene and dressing from “See You Again” track by Tyler in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">popular Tetema song</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a42d6402ca4bdb72.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Willy Paul exposed, Binyavanga Wainaina, Bahati and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Willy Paul, on the other hand, has been several times of dumping songs from upcoming artists the latest one being “Bora Uhai” featuring Papa Jones. His fans easily recognized that he had copied all his inspiration from the Gorilla x Saddat’s song which was officially released in July 2018.</p><h2>4. Pastor Ng’ang’a calls his bishops “Labbish, takataka” after playing with his wife</h2><p class=align-left>Pastor Ng'ang'a has again hit the headlines of celebrity news. This time not for an accident he caused or threatening Citizen TV’s Linus Kaikai but rather for something he said in his Neno Evangelism church.</p><p class=align-left>A six-minute clip has been making rounds through all the social media platforms of him telling his bishops to respect his wife failure to which he will kick them out of the ministry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/8855f616c3350707.jpeg><p class=align-left>The televangelist revealed that some of the Bishops were very poor when they joined his church.

If you climb up a tree, I will cut it down. I’m addressing you bishops in my church. If you are not going to respect my wife, I will kick you out of my ministry. It doesn’t matter who you are. Even if we were born together, this time around, I will show you my power. Any woman in this church that won’t respect my wife, tomorrow go and erect your church. Name it after yourself, Ng'ang'a spoke in a rant.<p class=align-left>Pastor Ng'ang'a didn’t stop there, he continued with his rant. He got hard on his church’s bishops.</p>You stupid people, you found me here! I have watched you amass wealth here at my church with those others. Stupid. Arrogant (bishops). You found me here preaching. You came to me with unkempt hair. Useless people, he uttered.<p class=align-left>Then he finished his insults with:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f8e05f9ee7a36613.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending Celebrity news: Diamond's new song, Bahati's troubles and more</span></p></a>lubbish, takataka.<p class=align-left>It was not over yet as he added to his previous statements while walking up to the church pulpit. The Neno Evangelism founder said that he was facing battles from the media because ‘satan wants to bring him down.’</p>There is nothing you people can tell me. I’m Neno. I’m facing these battles because of Neno. Satan wants to bring me down. That is why the devil is fighting me all over the media. Alafu, you sit there with your wife, and you think you will castrate me?” he said furiously before adding, “If you want to call yourself bishop, or whatever, make a note where you have come from. You came to me with your wife in tattered clothes. You should respect me. When I cough, you should jump the same way you used to when you were broke.”<p class=align-left>The furious pastor threatened to close down all their roles as bishops and affiliated churches. He also promised to punish all the clergy that had been involved in the scandal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b8a163a0bbb996ae.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz's wedding, Ben Pol's engagement, Otile brown's new song</span></p></a>And if you mess with me I will scrap all your roles as bishops and affiliate churches and remain with Neno only. I don’t like rubbish. I have heard rumours but this time around you will see me in full colours. I want my full respect from anyone who knows they were circumcised. Even that parliamentarian was removed from the group because he could not control it, the televangelist said.<p class=align-left>Standing in the pulpit, the ‘man of God’ looked at the congregation while having a pause before issuing a warning.</p>Before October 20. I am targeting you bishops if I do not bring you down, I am not called (by God). You must respect me. You must. If you don’t, I will bring you down, he warned.<p class=align-left>Twitter users criticized the pastor for insulting people in church while others thought that it was okay as it was a matter to do with his family.</p>I tell you, pastor ng'ang'a s wife is damn cute. He had all right to protect her from the preying congrats, Norman Biko tweeted.Pastor Ng'ang'a Why do people still go to this church????

R Kelly charged with 11 more sexual offences</h2><p class=align-left>Popular music artist R Kelly has been charged with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">11 additional sexual offences </a>on top of other ten accounts.</p><p class=align-left>According to Chicago Sun-Times, the new charges date back from 2010 and relate to sexual abuse and assault of a child aged between 13 to 16 years which is enough evidence is available will have more consequences than the others. In the state of Illinois, they are the most seriously taken felony class, and he may end up being imprisoned for six to thirty years.</p><p class=align-left>In the old charges, the award-winning rapper pleaded innocent and was released on bail. If enough evidence supports these ten accounts which involve four affected people, three of whom are minors, he could be jailed for around three to seven years.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking on his official Twitter account, his lawyer Steve Greenberg confirmed the new allegations saying that they do not relate to the old case.</p>He was recharged in an existing case, same alleged victim and time (a decade ago) It changes nothing. These are the same conduct, just charged differently, the same alleged victim, same time frame, same facts. We expect the same results, he wrote.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/96180a485304f9bc.jpeg><p class=align-left>The rapper has been accused by dozens of women for abusing them. Early this year, a documentary series titled, “Surviving R.Kelly” showed some victims which he allegedly abused talking of their experiences. However, R. Kelly remained firm and denied all the reports.</p><h2>6. Actress Njambi is expecting a baby, talks about her depression struggle</h2><p class=align-left>Popular House Helps of Kawangware actress, Njeri Gachomba popularly known as Njambi is expecting a second born child.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the actress keeping most of her private life news low from the media and public, she opened up on how she suffered a miscarriage.</p>I might not be ready to talk about it, but I still remember, she stated.<p class=align-left>She later urged Kenyans to remember all the children that were born sleeping and those who never made it for long.</p>A baby born after a miscarriage or loss of a baby is referred to as a Rainbow baby. Today we remember all the babies born sleeping, or we’ve carried but never met, those we’ve held but couldn’t take home, the ones that came home but didn’t stay. Make this your status if someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby. The majority won’t do it, because miscarriage, stillbirth, SIDS, and SUDC is a taboo subject. Break the silence, she urged Kenyans.<p class=align-left>Njambi narrated the pain she felt when she lost everything.</p>I remember when I took this photo; this was the day I lost everything I’ve ever worked for. I had sat on the stairs as they took everything from my house. My mum was so stressed land my brother, as usual, was cheering me up. I remember he was telling me about how I was used to having my bathroom in my bedroom asasa na rrudi lykutumia choo na kkila mtu (my brother though), she revealed.<p class=align-left>The actress explained how her daughter reacted when she got into the new small house.</p>I felt like my life was ending I mean I just got up now am being put down again. I remember otam came back from school and she was shocked, ‘haukuniambia tunahama! She was asking where our things are especially her toys…typical, she wrote.<p class=align-left>She then narrowed down to how she battled with depression after losing all that was hers. Njambi didn’t like how youths were ending their lives due to love, jobs, and money.</p>Anyway, it wasn’t supposed to be a long post but anyways since am half way…can i just say something about depression and how sad it is that young people are ending their lives because of love, money and jobs,” the actress said adding, “I’ve tried it all taking pills, countless times, I’ve tried to commit suicide, I’ve wanted to jump off my balcony a million times. I’ve scars because I used to cut myself…but every time I try sh*t, there comes Tamara complaining about something I said I'd do and I didn’t.<p class=align-left>The Kawangware actress concluded by advising depressed people who feel like taking their lives away because of life challenges.</p>If you ever feel depressed and you feel like you want to end your life please find a purpose, everyone has a purpose for living. I think the reason am still alive am still surviving is because of someone somewhere who is going through a lot and has no one to talk to, my DM is always open. I understand I know how it feels to be worthless, to have self-esteem, to feel unloved, I know.I am where you’re…. I get tattoos or piercings to numb my pain…I don’t know why I find pleasure and comfort in pain….. And to friends, please check up on your person. We depressed people don’t know how to talk, how to talk about our problems. We might look alright, but deep down we’re dying. I know I smile a lot, I joke a lot, but when I am alone, I am empty. Plus, depression is making me so fat, she concluded.<p class=align-left>When asked by one of her fans to give them tips to fight depression, the mother of one revealed that she doesn’t talk to anyone about her problems but rather locks herself in the bedroom to pray.</p>You know, depressed people are advised to talk about their issues, but it's never that easy for me because I hate talking about my problems. No one will ever understand the pain you are in, and that is why I prefer to lock myself in my bedroom and pray rather than talk to someone. It is so hard because once you are stressed by a small issue, you go back to square one. I listen to music, cry a lot, and I mean a lot, she wrote.<h2>7.

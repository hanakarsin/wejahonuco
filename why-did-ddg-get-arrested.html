A keen vlogger, DDG shared a range of informal clips before making a name for himself as a talented rapper. What happened?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did DDG get arrested? Here's what went down on Monday, June 6, 2022.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DDG</a> appears to have been riding down the streets of Los Angeles in a Lamborghini before getting stopped by LAPD on Monday, June 6, 2022. The police searched his car, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL Mag</a>, they found a concealed weapon — which is how he appears to have ended up in the Van Nuys Jail in Los Angeles.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube / PontiacMadeDDG VLOGS</a></figure><p>DDG spent the night in jail and left the facility on Tuesday, June 7, 2022 after paying the $35,000 bond. He will have to appear in court on June 28, 2022. This appears to be the first time DDG has hit the headlines because of a police arrest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">DDG released his debut LP, "Take Me Serious," in the fall of 2017.</h2><p>DDG took up an interest in music at an extraordinarily young age. Raised by an audio engineer father and a retail worker mother, he released "Big Boat," a diss track, in 2017 — and it's been an uphill ride ever since.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DDG (@ddg)</a></p></figure><p>His debut LP, "Take Me Serious," garnered a great deal of critical acclaim.

His newest release, "Storyteller," will drop on Friday, June 10, 2022.</p><p>DDG is a skilled boxer, having fought R&B and soul singer Nate Wyatt in the summer of 2021. And, as he revealed in an interview with fellow YouTuber <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Robin B</a>, he was the class valedictorian in high school — just like the title of his debut album would suggest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aclJx6qLHTZpirqpWowaaw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

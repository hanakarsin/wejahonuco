A whole new host of cleaning products are used to maintain the arena, as well.</p><p>And while a lot about attending a live sporting event is different these days, some things never change ‚Äî "Courtside Karen" and her argument with <a href=#>LeBron James</a> proves that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is "Courtside Karen" and why was she angry with LeBron James?</h2><p>Audience members heckle; that's what they do. Especially when they're passionate fans and the away team has the gall to come to their city's stadium and lay the smackdown on their franchise.</p><p>The Lakers beat the Hawks 107-99 in their visit to Atlanta, but two fans in particular weren't having it. In fact, it appeared they tried to get into LeBron's head during the game as the two got involved in an argument with the four-time NBA championship winner.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The referees stopped the game after LeBron was heckled by a spectator in Atlanta. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/apoDqvt4ll</a></p>‚Äî SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) <a href=#>February 2, 2021</a></figure><p>In the above clip, "Courtside Karen" can be seen standing up and confronting LeBron, who murmurs something about the situation and walks back onto the court. A stadium worker approaches the "Karen," whose mask is around her neck and not on her face. She tries to "wave" the situation off, indicating that she's done as she sits back down in her seat.</p><p>The confrontation was so disruptive that referees ended up stopping the action and talking with security officials. This additional angle provides further context for how seriously Courtside Karen's behavior was taken as several officials accosted her and her husband. It was pretty apparent that it wasn't going to end well for the woman, and it didn't.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Refs stop the game after a Hawks fan heckles LeBron <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NsoFjyel97</a></p>‚Äî Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) <a href=#>February 2, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">"Courtside Karen" was ID'd as Juliana Carlos, who gave her events of what happened with LeBron and her husband.</h2><p>Juliana and her husband were ultimately escorted out of the stadium. In a follow-up post on her Instagram page, she delineated what happened.</p><p>"So, I‚Äôm minding my own business, and Chris has been a Hawks fan forever. He‚Äôs been watching the games for 10 years. Whatever, he has this issue with LeBron. I don‚Äôt have an issue with LeBron. I don‚Äôt give a f--k about LeBron," she says in the clip.</p><p>She continues, "Anyway, I‚Äôm minding my own business ‚Ä¶ having fun. All of the sudden, LeBron says something to my husband, and I see this and I stand up. And I go, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt f--king talk to my husband.‚Äô And he looks at me and he goes, ‚ÄòSit the f--k down, b---h.‚Äô And I go, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt f--king call me a b---h. You sit the f--k down.

I miss that interaction. I need that interaction; we as players need that interaction. I don‚Äôt feel like it was warranted to be kicked out."</p><p>It appears that LeBron misses even the more confrontational aspects of fan participation, even if it means he's getting heckled. He didn't clearly delineate exactly what Chris Carlos said, but indicated that both he and his wife seemed a little tipsy.</p><p>"They might have had a couple drinks, maybe. And they could have probably kept it going during the game, and the game wouldn‚Äôt have been about the game no more, so I think the referees did what they had to do."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>yeah so james just randomly cussed out some entitled fuck on the sideline? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2Hiljrj9eN</a></p>‚Äî samwise (@SamSmash74) <a href=#>February 2, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She was recording his every move before it happened, she a fanüòÇ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/G6MjzmjcL7</a></p>‚Äî Money D.

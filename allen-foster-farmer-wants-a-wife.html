It has "aired in 32 countries and resulted in 180 marriages and 410 children," reported the outlet. It only made sense that eventually America's heartland would be a place the wild dating show could call home.</p><p>Allen Foster is one of the men on Farmer Wants a Wife. Let's get to know him on a more personal level. Obviously, he's looking for a wife. Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Allen Foster from and what does he do for a living?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Sun</a>, Allen hails from Tennessee where he owns a <a href=#>cattle ranch</a>. Something Allen simply couldn't wrap his mind around is the idea that women would leave a city, looking for a country mouse. "One of the funniest things was they were all excited about having an opportunity to be there and dating a rancher," the 32-year-old told the outlet. For him that's just life, but for these ladies their day-to-day was a foreign novelty and it showed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span><p>Allen Foster</p></figure><p>Clearly, this show will be filled with plenty of "fish out of water" scenarios that people of a certain age can compare to the Pauly Shore movie Son-in-Law. This was certainly the case for Allen who had to introduce his <a href=#>potential wife</a> to some literal dirty work. "We go to work some cows, and a couple of them get a little manure on their hands, and you would’ve thought they cut their arm completely off," he said. "I don’t know how you plan on being a rancher’s wife if you can’t deal with a little cow manure."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Allen's Instagram is all about that farm life, of course.</h2><p>Well shoot y'all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen's Instagram</a> is a real who's who of animals he has killed and while we understand that's just how it works in the country it sure is tough to look at! From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">catching a 50 pound fish</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hunting elk</a>, it certainly paints a picture of what life on the farm could look like for one lucky lady. Don't worry, there's clearly a respect for animals that comes with being on a ranch.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Allen Foster (@allwfost)</a></p></figure><p>There are several photos of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen riding horseback</a> through some of the most gorgeous countryside America has to offer. Seriously, it looks like he lives in a Hallmark movie. He isn't just riding horses. Occasionally, you'll find Allen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on a boat</a>, behind the wheel of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huge farm machinery</a>, or perhaps <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">manning a big rig</a>.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promo for the show</a>, Allen reveals that farming has been his "entire life" but now he's ready for the "next chapter." What does that entail? Well, settling down and starting a family of course. "I want to be a husband and a father someday." Thankfully Allen is bringing some wisdom to this experience. "I've learned lots of things from past relationships," he said. "To me love is more of a feeling than words spoken. I just want somebody to like me for who I am, take it or leave it."</p><p>Farmer Wants a Wife airs Wednesdays at 9:00 p.m. EST on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmtsc1mnairpJq%2FbrLAq6Seql2srq%2FA0maYZq%2BZm7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

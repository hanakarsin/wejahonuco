This, if allowed, could be a fatal ground for anarchy.</p><p>“Intelligence also reveals that one Elewe-Omo, a transport union leader in Ibadan, Oyo State, has perfected plans to attack organisers of the rally as a reprisal for the death of one of his followers allegedly killed by one of Igboho’s group.</p><p>“The cumulative effect of all these is a threat to law and order. The command will not watch and allow disgruntled elements truncate the peace being enjoyed in the state.</p><p>“Lagos State cannot afford to experience any security lapses, breakdown of law and order, and threat to public peace at the moment, considering the negative effects and reoccurring agonies of the October 2020 #Endsars crisis that led to massive destruction of public and private facilities, and some police personnel paying the supreme price. This is in addition to many police stations, barracks, officers’ personal properties that were burnt.</p><p>“The command is still going through those harrowing experiences, and it will not be cajoled by the so-called organisers that the rally will be peaceful. That was the same slogan adopted by organisers of the #Endsars protest which eventually snowballed into crises with attendant destruction of lives and properties.</p><p>“The police will not submit to their antics. Recall that on June 12, there was a rumored stay-at-home order purported to have been issued by a group, which was immediately debunked by the command.</p><p>“On this note, the command reaffirms that on no account will any actual or rumored activity, including the said planned mega rally, be allowed to lockdown the state or hinder the people’s daily activities.</p><p>“The command hereby appeals to the people, especially Lagosians, to shun the rally, while parents and guardians are urged to discourage their children and wards from participating therein.”</p><p>Odumosu added that Lagos is yet to recover from the negative experiences of the #EndSARS protests and can’t afford another breakdown of law and order.</p><p>He however said law-abiding residents can go about their activities on the said day without any fear as their safety is guaranteed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49qZrCdXay8r8CMmqOlp6dirq%2FFjKuYpaSpYravecuanqirXaW8rbXCnmStnZyheqqzwaifqGWRoLavwM6ynGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

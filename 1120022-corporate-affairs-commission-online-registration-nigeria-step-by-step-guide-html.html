Fortunately, the portal makes things easier. All you need to do is follow these simple steps.</p><li>Go to the official website of the commission</li><li>Next, you need to click on the public search engine</li><li>You will get a prompt that directs you to the search record by name where you then enter the name of the company</li><li>You need to prove that you are not a robot by clicking on the search engine and then verify that you are not a robot</li><li>A result comes up giving details of the RC number, the company name, the registered address as well as the date of registration</li><li>In case the company is in the process of undergoing registration, the results will come out detailing the current company status.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt3eafn444bsfg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Useful guide on how to download NOUN courseware for School of science and technology</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Consider using CAC portal for all your business registration needs in Nigeria.

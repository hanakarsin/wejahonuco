The latest drop is filled with drama, reveals, and truly everything we want out of a <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> binge.</p><p>One of those reveals is from the ever-relatable Nancy Rodriguez. In Episode 6, Nancy is talking about her ex-boyfriend to her fiancé, Bartise, and drops the bomb that they actually still own rental properties together.</p><p>OK, so maybe Nancy should have been more upfront about this, but she and Bartise actually have a pretty productive conversation.</p><p>So, who is said "ex" anyway? Well, that would be one Tony Adams. And we found out all there is to know about him so that you don't have to. You're welcome!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nancy runs an Airbnb business with her ex-boyfriend Tony.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Airbnb</a></figure><p>In the pods, Nancy told Bartise that her ex was her realtor, but it turns out that Tony is a lot more than that. The two are actually business partners and own a few short-term rental properties together, which they renovated before listing on Airbnb.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The above property</a> is the one that we saw on Love Is Blind. Nancy and Tony also definitely still work together because she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted him on her IG story</a> about three weeks ago, as he worked on some tile.</p><p>Tony has other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb properties</a> that he owns by himself as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In addition to Airbnb, Tony has his own real estate business.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@t0nyrealest</a></figure><p>Tony owns his own real estate firm, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Adams Realty</a>, and was even once on an episode of House Hunters. The caption for the post above reads, "I’m excited I had the opportunity to perform on tonight’s episode of House Hunters!!! I’m the realtor for an engaged couple in Austin, Texas."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tony is also a firefighter!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@t0nyrealest</a></figure><p>Tony has been with the Dallas Fire Department for seven years now. In a post from November 2020, he wrote, "Time flies! I’m going on five years with the Dallas Fire Dept. I work with some amazing people, and I have time to build my real estate empire. If there’s a better job, I’d like to hear about it. #firefighter #dallas #realestate."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But that's not all! Tony is an actor/writer/editor/producer.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tonyrealest href=#>@tonyrealest</a><p>Rock Star Tony <a title=blackrockstar href=#>#blackrockstar</a> <a title=rock href=#>#rock</a> <a title=heavymetal href=#>#heavymetal</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryourpage href=#>#foryourpage</a> <a title=nobodygoneseethis href=#>#nobodygoneseethis</a></p><a title="♬ Black Hole Sun - Soundgarden" href=#>♬ Black Hole Sun - Soundgarden</a></figure><p>Tony sure does love to ham it up! While we couldn't find any actual films or TV shows that he's been in, he has lots of comedic #content on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tonyrealest href=#>@tonyrealest</a><p>Guess that film <a title=fyp href=#>#Fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Splack" href=#>♬ original sound - Splack</a></figure><p>Tony seems to be a man of many talents. And while it didn't work out with Nancy, we're sure he's a great guy since the pair still work, and even own property together!</p><p>Best of luck to you Tony. May you flip houses, put out fires, and produce silly videos for many years to come!</p><p>Make sure to catch the first seven episodes of Season 3 of Love Is Blind currently streaming on Netflix!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo66vr9hmnLFlkqTGp77InqWdZZykw6Z5yKxkm6SZo7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: Getty ImagesMarvel actors tend to stay in pretty great shape. Actors like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth have chiseled their bodies to perfection, and the same was true of Chadwick Boseman, who plays Black Panther. Now that he’s in quarantine, though, it seems that Chadwick has lost some of the muscle mass that he has when he appears in the role."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Actors like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth have chiseled their bodies to perfection, and the same was true of Chadwick Boseman, who plays <a href=#>Black Panther</a>. Now that he’s in quarantine, though, it seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chadwick</a> has lost some of the muscle mass that he has when he appears in the role.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does Chadwick Boseman look so skinny?</h2><p>In a new video posted to his Instagram page, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chadwick</a> is promoting Operation 42, an initiative aimed at helping people of color across the country who are battling the coronavirus. Although the initiative is undoubtedly a good cause, something else about the video distracted many people from the work Chadwick is doing. In the video, he looks skinnier than he has ever looked on screen, which got some fans concerned.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time that Chadwick has looked thinner when he wasn’t currently in the middle of filming. A few months ago, he was looking skinnier at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA All-Star Game</a>, and he also looked thin at last year’s American Music Awards. Still, the new video led some to wonder whether the Black Panther star was ill, or whether he’d actually tested positive for the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p><p>As of right now, it seems that Chadwick is fine, and he hasn’t made any statements about why he may have slimmed down. It’s possible that he‘s naturally a thinner guy, and he only feels the need to beef up when he’s about to appear in a <a href=#>Marvel</a> movie. Because he’s on a filming break, he’s let himself trim down. Chris Hemsworth does something similar when he’s not preparing to play Thor. In his time off, the actor looks noticeably thinner.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The expectations around playing a superhero are intense.</h2><p>It can be incredibly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">physically demanding</a> to get in the shape you need to be in to play a superhero. The stars of these franchises often have to go on extreme diets to get as ripped as they need to be, and they also have to do a number of incredibly intense workouts every day. When they’re not filming, they’re entitled to a break from all of that hard work.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I am hearing stories of desperation from people all over the country, and we know our communities are suffering the most and urgently need help.

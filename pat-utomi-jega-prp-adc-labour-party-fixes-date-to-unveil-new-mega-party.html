We cannot call it a political party for now because talks are still ongoing,” a source told PUNCH.</p><p>“I’m aware that talks between leaders of the Peoples Redemption Party including Professor Attahiru Jega, those of the African Democratic Congress including its National Chairman, Chief Ralph Nwosu and the Labour Party, have reached an advanced stage.</p><p>“The proposal being considered is the collapse of the structures of existing political parties involved into one strong one. We recognise the fact that forming a political party from the scratch is both cumbersome and capital intensive.</p><p>“It will involve getting offices across the 36 states of the federation and Abuja and going through all kinds of hurdles before being registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission and we know time is of the essence.</p><p>“To avoid this, we are looking at first agreeing on terms of engagement. We will adopt a name, hold our conventions where structures will be collapsed into one then we will approach INEC for a change of name to reflect our new identity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FsZqmZpGLCtbvMomSjnZeWerG%2Bz2aYnZtdoa6ju9SrZKmZoqnGbrLIsZysZZSWwaZ506hkrqammratec2ermallZyubrzAq6uyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

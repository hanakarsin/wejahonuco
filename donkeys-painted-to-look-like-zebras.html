This animal knows it's been scamming zoo-quality grub and a fancy stable just by wearing a different suit of clothes. It's amazing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The incriminating photos were taken by an Egyptian student named Mahmoud Sarhan at the Cairo International Garden park. Sarhan claimed there were two painted animals in the enclosure, and his assertion is being backed up by experts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Wildlife biologist Alex Adams explained all the many, many reasons why this animal is definitely a donkey and not a zebra.</p><p>‚ÄúThe stripes (on a zebra) are always defined, never smudged, and zebras can be small but never that small,‚Äù said Adams.</p><p>‚ÄúThe ears are rounded, not oblong and pointy, and of course zebras have black skin, answering that age-old question of them being black with white stripes.‚Äù</p><p>Yep, that's a painted donkey.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The zoo's director, Mohamed Sultan, is not yet ready to give up the game. When contacted by a local radio station about the viral photos, Mohamed insisted the zebras were the real thing.</p><p>It's possible he thinks they are, which would mean he's not a scammer, just a terrible zoo keeper. Which is worse?</p><p>Meanwhile, people are making hay of this false zebra online:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you think your job is bad.

While Tibetan Mastiffs are pretty big and hairy, you can't hide that bark. Once the dog started yelping in front of visitors, the jig was up.</p><p>The zookeepers there claimed the lion was being checked out by a vet and the dog had been placed in the cage due to "safety concerns," but other animals were mislabeled in the zoo, including another dog being passed off as a wolf.</p><p>Look, if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's that zoos are bad.</p><p>But donkeys are good. I hope that when Mohamed is finally ready to admit that here are no zebras in Cairo, at least not in public parks, the donkeys still get to keep their home. They've gone too deep into the role to retreat now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify:</h2><p><a href=#>Man Keeps Facebook Scammer Occupied So Long They Forget What They're Doing</a></p><p><a href=#>This Zoo Gives Animals Amazon Reviews That Are Absolutely 5 Stars</a></p><p><a href=#>Here's All The Zoo Animal Baby Drama You Need To Know This Season</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpaGR9eHuRcGaTiZ5ugLZ7w6ilpJ2pqHqxrcinq56cXam8brjOqKJmpJmgsm7GxJupmqs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

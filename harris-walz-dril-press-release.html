Twitter began in 2006, and a mere two years later, an account known as dril began climbing the Weird Twitter charts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Twitter began in 2006, and a mere two years later, an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">account known as dril</a> began climbing the Weird Twitter charts. To the youth reading this, Twitter used to be a very fun, extremely strange place to live. We're sorry you missed it. Heck, even Weird Twitter has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its own Wikipedia page</a>.</p><p>As of August 2024, the @dril account has over 2 million followers, and we suspect it's about to get a bunch more. Social media is losing its mind over the fact that a dril tweet was used in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harris/Walz press release</a>. Many people went from feeling quite panicked about the fate of the Democratic party, to familiarizing themselves with someone who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writes things like</a>, "(insufferably) It's pronounced. 'Bloomin Onion.' The 'g' is silent." Let's get into this press release!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@dril</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">We are now calling this the Harris/Walz dril Press Release. Thank you and good night.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News reporter Ryan J. Reilly</a> was just one of numerous people to post the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harris/Walz press release</a> that included this dril tweet: "and another thing: im not mad. please dont put in the newspaper that i got mad." The title of the press release was "Donald Trump's Very Good, Very Normal Press Conference," and it reads like a Tumblr blog.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release fact-checks</a> a press conference former president Donald Trump held Aug. 4, 2024, in which he claimed to have bigger crowds for his events than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have had for theirs. He also compared the crowd at his Jan. 6, 2021 speech to those who listened to Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They're using dril memes. It's over. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YdJEPmqPV1</a></p>— Alejandra Caraballo (@Esqueer_) <a href=#>August 8, 2024</a></figure><p>Reactions to the inclusion of a dril tweet have been mixed. "Oh my... dril made it into the latest VP Harris press release," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted writer Charlotte Clymer</a>. Brittany Shepherd, a national politics reporter at ABC News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked that she was</a> "not looking forward to a 'dril' explainer news cycle." Thankfully, that's not what we're doing here!</p><p>The most important person to weigh in was of course dril himself, who was less than pleased with his inclusion in the press release. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retweeted Ryan and wrote</a>, "in case you thought IDF R--- Camps were the worst thing our government is sanctioning." Still, he did share it on his own feed. Someone who truly disliked the association would probably just ignore it. Well, that's social media for ya!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6zvsisZLCZnK96pb7IpWSpqpWowG6%2BxKWcmquV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

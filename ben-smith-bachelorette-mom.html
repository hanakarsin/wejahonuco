Now that she's taken over, and she has a group of guys who are interested in getting to know her, one guy seems to stand out as one we need to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben Smith is 30 years old, and he's starting to get a lot more screen time now. Whether or not Ben is the final rose recipient, his vulnerability and sweetness has gotten him a lot of fans from the public.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Madalyn Marie (@madalynsmith)</a></p></figure><p>After he left active duty from his time in the Army, where he became a Ranger, due to breaking his back, he turned his interest into health, nutrition, and fitness.

He has been sharing small snippets of information about his family on social media, before he was a contestant on The Bachelorette.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We've learned that he's close to his mom. He shared a post on May 14, 2017 giving thanks and a shoutout to his mom, along with a photo of him with his mom, dad, and sister.</p><p>"To the OG, I am the way I am because of you," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.

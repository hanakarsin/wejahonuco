Among the dead were some pregnant women.</p><p>However according to an eyewitness who was present at the scene, the casualties stated were more than that saying "<i>It was up to fifty that were injured and 25 were dead".</i></p><p>Although there's has been no official list of casualties yet. The bodies of the dead applicants have been deposited at the National Hospital Abuja morgue.</p><p>Also an applicant who decided to turn back home upon seeing the massive crowd said<i> “I can tell you that more than 100,000 people came for this test”, he said. “I have never seen this kind of crowd before in my life. Even if this was a FIFA World Cup football match, you will never get spectators this many”.</i></p><p>Apparently according to an eyewitness the stampede broke out as applicants rushed towards a central stage, since it was only just one entrance to the 60,000-capacity stadium that was open.</p><p>The hospital spokesman, Tayo Haastrup who confirmed the incident said<i> “The immigration service was having a recruitment exercise at the stadium … there was a stampede and they brought the victims to the national hospital. </i><i>Those with stable injuries “will be sent to other hospitals so that we can deal with the numerous injured that continue to arrive”. </i><i></i></p><p>The hospital could not admit many of those injured due to lack of capacity. It has also been reported that a similar incident occurred in the Port-Harcourt centre with one person feared dead and many rushed to the hospital as a result of&nbsp; exhaustion.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3KEl25loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Is she married right now? Here’s what fans of the pop singer and actress should know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Janet Jackson’s first marriage was with James DeBarge from 1984 to 1985.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When Janet was only 18 years old, she married another singer named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James DeBarge</a>. He was part of a music group from the '80s called DeBarge, and he caught Janet’s attention for more than one reason. One of the reasons she decided to marry him was to gain independence from her father and manager, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jackson</a>. The marriage ended in an annulment rather than divorce when it was over.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Janet Jackson’s second marriage was with René Elizondo Jr. from 1991 to 2000.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Janet started dating a songwriter named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">René Elizondo Jr.</a> in 1987, two years after she and James ended things. Janet and René dated each other on a serious level for four years before secretly tying the knot in 1991. Throughout the course of their romance, he was extremely supportive of her music career. In fact, they co-wrote 37 songs together!</p><p>In 2000, they officially got divorced. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes,</a> he ended up slapping Janet with a lawsuit for a whopping $25 million. They settled for $10 million after he made claims that he signed the prenuptial agreement under duress. When Janet's marriage with René was officially over, she dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jermaine Dupri</a> from 2002 to 2009. The long-term relationship did not result in marriage though.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Janet Jackson was then married to Wissam Al Mana from 2012 to 2017.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Janet started dating a businessman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wissam Al Mana</a> in 2010. By 2012, they were married. They welcomed her first child into the world, Eissa, in 2017. Not too long after the birth of their son, the couple filed for divorce. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, they cited “cultural differences” as the reason for their split. Although Janet and Wissam filed for divorce in 2017, it's unclear if their divorce has been finalized at this point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Janet Jackson married now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As of now, Janet isn’t married to anyone. Her three marriages and long-term relationship with Jermaine are still heavily talked about in the media though. A couple of other public relationships Janet was involved with in the past include <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey,</a> whom she went on a date with some time in the early 2000s, and a rapper named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Q-Tip,</a> whom she dated in 2002.</p><p>Matthew discussed his date with Janet on a 2019 appearance of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>.

The PA would leave Lagos 10am and arrive in London 3pm.</p><p>“He had to go to Bond Street to buy Fela’s favorite sweet. The name of the PA was Femi Bankole Osula but we called him ‘Femi Photo’ because he was also Fela’s photographer.</p><p>“He would arrive in Lagos the next morning with the sweet and ice cream. Does that mean Fela is not a pan-Africanist because he likes to lick ice cream?</p><p>“You must not enjoy the sweet creams of this life, is that your idea of pan-Africanist? ‘I’m not African because I was born in Africa, I’m African because Africa was born in me.’ It means that for those little pressures that you want to get, you must never betray or sabotage your own people. I will never destroy Africa just because I want luxury.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FvZp%2BdnJZ6tr%2FEnWStp12osq%2BwjKGgrGWglnq1u4ylpqecn6N6tbuMm6yyZaOssqbA0magnJ1dmL%2Bmrcxmqp6tnmK4tsDIaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

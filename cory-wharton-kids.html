Especially <a href=#>Cory Wharton</a>, who is not only Cheyenne Floyd's ex and the father of her baby, but also a recurring cast member on MTV's The Challenge. Needless to say, Cory is ingrained in the network's world of reality TV.</p><p>But outside of competing on reality shows, he is a busy dad. And Cory's kids are the most important thing to him. In the Oct. 4, 2022, episode of <a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a>, Cory is faced with a difficult situation as one of his daughters is diagnosed with a heart condition.</p><p>His daughter with Cheyenne, Ryder, lives with a VLCAD deficiency, which means her body isn't able to break down certain fats into energy. But this is different. Let's learn more about Cory's kids and see how Ryder is doing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@taylor.selfridge</a></figure><p>While Cory's youngest daughter wasn't diagnosed with this same genetic disorder, at least as of right now, she does show signs of another health problem. Naturally, it's cause for concern for Cory and he shares his worries on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter while he also parents his other two children with both Cheyenne and his girlfriend, Taylor Selfridge.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Cory Wharton's kids?</h2><p>Cory shares Ryder with <a href=#>Cheyenne</a>. Outside of that former relationship, Cory has two kids with longtime girlfriend Taylor. They welcomed their daughter Mila in 2020. Then, in June 2022, Taylor gave birth to their second daughter, Maya. But don't expect the couple to have a third baby together any time soon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cory Wharton (@corywharton_ig)</a></p></figure><p>Following the birth of Maya, Taylor shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that she and Cory "are not quite ready" for another little one. But they seem to have their hands full with the two they share and, of course, Ryder, who Cory co-parents with Cheyenne.</p><p>And if we're being honest here, their co-parenting relationship may be one of the healthiest that Teen Mom fans have ever seen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cory's daughter's heart condition causes concern on 'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.'</h2><p>Shortly after Maya was born, she had to undergo open heart surgery. She was diagnosed with tricuspid atresia, which is a congenital heart disease.</p><p>"As a parent, you're scared, worried, nervous, angry, sad, [and] mad and you don't understand why this is happening to your baby," Cory wrote on Instagram after Maya's first successful surgery.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cory Wharton (@corywharton_ig)</a></p></figure><p>He added that he and Taylor are hopeful for the remaining two surgeries to go as well as the first. At the time, they were eager to take Maya home. Since then, they seem to be doing well at home as a busy family of five.</p><p>"It was rough to see them go through such a hard time," Cheyenne told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a>. "And for us, we just wanted to make sure that they knew that we supported them. But it was hard. It was definitely the roughest I've ever seen Cory and I was worried about him. So it's a lot of me checking in or Zach checking in."</p><p>In regards to how this is affecting Ryder, Cheyenne said that they are doing their best to be honest her.</p><p>"We didn't want her to take that anxiety within starting a new school and she's in a new home," Cheyenne explained. "There were so many changes going on around her so we tried to protect her, but at the same time, we kept her in the loop so she felt included in what was happening with Maya."</p><p>But in the Oct. 4, 2022, episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, fans will see how scary the beginning of Cory and Taylor's journey with Maya is.</p><p>Watch Teen Mom: The Next Chapter on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyzxYywn5qqpKS7brfInao%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

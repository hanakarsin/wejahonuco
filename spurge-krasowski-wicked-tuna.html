(According to his Facebook profile, Spurge has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>been in the business since 1971</u></a>.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Wicked Tuna - All Tangled Up</a><p>After a tuna gets tangled up on the anchor line, Spurge and Ryan have to work in perfect harmony to get it untangled without losing the fish.

According to the Coast Guard, the man had harpooned a bluefin tuna off Morehead City, N.C., but was pulled into the ocean and drowned when the fish swam away.&nbsp;</p><p>Another fisherman discovered the man’s empty boat, reeled in the line, and found the man’s body along with the harpooned fish, which was still alive. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an archived copy of the article</u></a>, Spurge said the fishing line was wrapped around the man’s ankle and that “the fish was still there.”</p><p>Wicked Tuna Season 10 airs Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on National Geographic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL22vsaeZKSqkai8uL%2FKomSwoZOgsqV5066lmg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

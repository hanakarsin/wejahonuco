The leader who is in power since Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980 claims he was ordained by God to rule forever. Besides, he accused his&nbsp;<a href=#>Vice-President Joice Mujuru who was sacked&nbsp;alongside eight other ministers</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;allegedly plotting to assassinate him and involvement&nbsp;in corrupt activities.</p><p>In President Mugabe own words,<i>"We managed to know what (Ms) Mujuru was doing at her house, even consulting witchdoctors. Recently she invited two Nigerian witchdoctors. We heard that they were specialists in the field of witchcraft.</i></p><p><i>They were specialists, yes, but specialists in robbing people, foolish people.&nbsp;Where do these Nigerians get the powers to entrap the soul of a human being into a chicken or sheep and then kill him? God is for us all. I also go to church, I do not believe in superstition. We were taught God’s teachings."</i></p><p>The president claims that the witchdoctors&nbsp;ordered Ms Mujuru to buy chickens that were named after herself, the President, his wife and Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Then the birds&nbsp;were slaughtered and Ms&nbsp;Mujuru was promised that deaths of her political opponents&nbsp;inevitable.</p><p>Former Zimbabwe Vice-President Joice Mujuru has described claims by President Robert Mugabe as ‘presidential fancy and lies.&nbsp;<i>"I am a committed Christian and was the leader of apostolic churches as patron and I have been committed to Christian life and values all of my life.</i></p><p><i>It is disturbing that the allegations that I tried to or was part of a conspiracy to assassinate the president have now been reduced to allegations of witchcraft, whose versions change on a daily basis.&nbsp;I am sure even the ordinary Zimbabwean has become tired of this story in its various guises. It’s a charade which has lost steam."</i></p><p>It would be recalled that <a href=#>the uncomplimentary remarks</a> made last year&nbsp;by President Robert Mugabe that Nigeria stinks of corruption has set off a diplomatic row between the two African countries. The federal government formally protested the remark <a href=#>by summoning the Zimbabwean Head of Chancery, Mr. Stanley Kunjeku</a>, who was told in blunt terms that Nigeria would not tolerate such unwarranted attack on its image and people.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHqBlWpsZqaZnLKztcCnZLChpJi1pbvCraarq12pv6qxw2arqGWbnrmtecyunpqalWLEqsDHZpqhoZOgsq%2B%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

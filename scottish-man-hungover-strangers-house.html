Source: facebookIf you're about that boozy life, then you've probably had one or two instances of waking up, opening your eyes, and not recognizing the ceiling. That's a pretty terrifying few seconds, and an experience that everyone who's partied a bit too hard can relate to.
Not knowing where you are or how you ended up there, you start to replay the events of the prior night in your head."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's a pretty terrifying few seconds, and an experience that everyone who's partied a bit too hard can relate to.</p><p>Not knowing where you are or how you ended up there, you start to replay the events of the prior night in your head. Unfortunately, doing so when you're hungover probably isn't the best way to piece together the events. That's why it's always great to have some friends around, preferably some cell phone footage taken from the night before so you can reconstruct the night.</p><p>But what happens when that stranger's house you ended up in is actually a stranger's house? Not a person you hooked up with, or a friend of a friend who decided to care for your drunk ass after a night of debauchery, but an honest-to-goodness stranger.</p><p>If I woke up to find a rando just sleeping on my floor or couch, I'd be very, very scared. This Scotsman, fortunately, ended up crashing in a house belonging to some very understanding people.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>After finding himself in the hilarious predicament, he immediately whipped out his phone and shared video evidence of the interaction. This is one of those stories you're going to tell at a bar, and there'll inevitably be one person calling BS, so it's best to grab some proof just in case.</p><p>In the video, he can be seen doing his best to make sense of the entire situation.</p><p>"A couple woke me up going. 'Who are you?'" he began.</p><p>"I'm like, 'What are you talking about? I was here at the party last night.'</p><p>"And he went, 'Trust me man, there was no party here last night.'"</p><p>So it turns out that this lad thought he was asleep in the house he was partying at the night before. Instead, he managed to amble toward his home and end up in someone else's.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>The couple were more than understanding and found the entire situation hilarious. They even did their best to help him get over his hangover, giving him a cigarette and offering a cup of tea.</p><p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say that these folks have been to their fair share of devastatingly fun parties.</p><p>After a while, our hero came to understand how he ended up in these fine folks' home.</p><p>"I went to get a taxi last night," he said. "The taxi left and I came into the wrong house. I came in, got a cover and went to sleep."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>During his tour, he sees a pot of uncooked noodles in the kitchen and concedes that he must have attempted to cook himself up a late night snack.</p><p>As his video winds down, he thanks the couple and remarks that he probably wouldn't have been so fortunate had he ended up in someone else's home.</p><p>"Thank god this woman is from Glasgow," he said. "She was like ,'Aye, we're welcoming.' Got a cup of tea and a [smoke]! Thank you very much for being so understanding."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>Isn't that heartwarming?

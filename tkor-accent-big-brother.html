It's not easy, but hey, these people sign up for the gig. And each season, viewers have questions about the more memorable cast members. For Season 26, that includes <a href=#>T'Kor Clottey</a>.</p><p>She gets into an uncomfortable conversation with Angela Murray, where she points out that Angela's comments about multiple Black houseguests hanging out could be perceived as problematic. As T'Kor gets frustrated, defending herself and trying not to be hard on Angela at the same time, her accent comes through in some big ways. But for those who didn't quite catch what she said about it during the premiere, what's up with T'Kor's accent on Big Brother?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">T'Kor's accent on 'Big Brother' has to do with where she grew up.</h2><p>T'Kor explains during the Season 26 premiere that her accent is an unusual mix between what you might hear in England, Chicago, and even Atlanta. In fact, she claims three hometowns — London, U.K., Chicago, Ill., and Atlanta, Ga. Because she grew up in different places with so many different accents, T'Kor's accent is a combination of them that is more noticeable when she gets excited or, in the case of Angela, frustrated.</p><p>She explains in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">preseason interview</a> that she grew up in a "low income household in the South Side of Chicago, raised by two lesbian mothers." She also spent time in London and, later, Atlanta. As a result, T'Kor's accent is sort of hard to place. And sometimes, it doesn't come out very strong. Or, at least, parts of the accent are stronger than others. So when T'Kor's accent does sound more prominent, it's a bit of a shock.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by T’kor Clottey (@tkorcouture)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Angela's behavior has frustrated the majority of the other houseguests.</h2><p>T'Kor also said in her preseason interview that she planned to fly under the radar a bit and be perceived as someone who is more soft spoken and gentle, seen crocheting in the corner. And part of that has been true. But when Angela makes a comment to Quinn Martin about T'Kor, Cam Sullivan-Brown, Chelsie Baham, and Cedric Hodges talking outside, T'Kor uses the opportunity to explain to Angela why it could be perceived in a negative way toward a group of Black people.</p><p>What follows is Angela crying to essentially anyone who will listen to her. And, while T'Kor laments that she believes Angela's comments weren't from a hateful palace, it's still T'Kor who is put in the position of comforting Angela, when Angela is one of the most out of pocket houseguests in Season 26.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST, and on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS and Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbiwvoyampydnql6o7XGZpmrp6SdsrM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Source: twitterIn 1992 a glorious film starring Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes hit the theaters: White Men Can't Jump.
Now there's a lot to be said about this movie. There's the Sizzler references, there's Wesley Snipes' layered lowcut tank tops and Woody Harrelson's tie-dye baseball cap, and, of course Rosie Perez's love for the game Jeopardy!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The judges ultimately give it to her in the movie, but the correct answer is "Vesuvius."</p><p>It's a technicality that angered me. I mean, yeah, she was close enough, but it clearly wasn't the answer. It also led me to believe that Trebek and the judges on Jeopardy were a bit lenient towards some of the contestants.

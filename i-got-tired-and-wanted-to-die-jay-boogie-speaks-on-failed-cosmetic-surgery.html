It was becoming so annoying that the bullying online was even too much. I was receiving death threats. People will come to my DM and be like, ‘You never still die?’ So, I decided to stay off the media for a while.</p><p>“I wasn’t the one that sent out my pictures on social media. It was my friends. I’m a discreet person. I don’t like flaunting things. I love living a low-key life. Because nobody cares about you. You should care about yourself.</p><p>“So, I mean, with the dramas going online, people bullying me saying, ‘How man go go do nyansh.’ Can you even imagine the mentality? Do you even see me as a man? This is something I want for myself. And I’m sure that if I were to be any of their siblings they won’t tell me that they won’t feel the pains I’m going through. I started going to dialysis every day just so I can pass out urine. My legs were swollen. The urine was very high. At that point, I was measuring my intake of water. Before I go for dialysis they will check my weight and I will be weighing 100 and something. Every day, I would be going for dialysis, they will be taking out my blood and all that. It was hurting that I sat down and said, ‘God abeg, I am just tired. I just want to go [die]. What am I even doing? Who send me to come do this nyansh sef?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49wZqJll6TBbsDIq5ydZZGjsW7DwKernpxdqbxusMieZKOZqWKvsLvGopxmq6Carqy%2FjKilZp6RnrmmsIycpqyllam2pHnSrqmgnaKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

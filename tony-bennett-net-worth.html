Tony was nominated in November 2021 for five Grammys alongside collaborative partner Lady Gaga and is the second-oldest Grammy nominee in history (the first, per LA Times, is Pinetop Perkins at 97)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, Tony's retirement did not yet signal the conclusion of his career, and on Sept. 30, 2021, he released an album with Lady Gaga titled "Love for Sale."</p><p>Tony has also broken several Guinness World Records. In 1962, he broke the record for the longest span of top-10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart for any living artist, and his "Love for Sale" album broke the record for the oldest person to release an album of new material.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Between his record-breaking albums and astounding performance history, it should be no surprise that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> lists Tony's estimated net worth as $200 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Tony Bennett</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer, Painter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $200 million</p><p>Tony Bennett is an American singer of pop standards, big band, show tunes, and jazz.</p><p>After fighting as a U.S. infantryman in the final stages of World War II, Tony signed with Columbia Records in 1950.

In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Danny explained, "Doing concerts now is just too much for him," he said. "We don't want him to fall on stage, for instance — something as simple as that. We're not worried about him being able to sing. We are worried, from a physical standpoint ... about human nature."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Tony's wife, Susan Crow, also put her foot down out of concern for Tony's health. "She said, 'Absolutely not.'" The singer's son revealed to the public in 2020 that Tony had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2016. People have been astounded Tony was still performing live and making music with his condition, and to those in disbelief, Danny has something to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"Dealing as we have with Alzheimer’s for the last four-five years, it’s cognitive. He has short-term memory loss. That, however, does not mean that he doesn’t still have all this stored up inside of him. He doesn’t use a Teleprompter. He never misses a line. He hits that stage and goes. Tony may not remember every part of doing that show. But, when he stepped to the side of the stage, the first thing he told me was: ‘I love being a singer.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyvxYybnKemlanBbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

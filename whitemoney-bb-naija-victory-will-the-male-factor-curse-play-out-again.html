The Big Brother show has had six seasons so far and produced five male and one female winner.
Let’s take a walk down history lane and peruse over the previous BB Naija victors and how well they have done for themselves so far."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But will that be all for Whitemoney or is there something more to come?</p><p>The Big Brother show has had six seasons so far and produced five male and one female winner.</p><p>Let’s take a walk down history lane and peruse over the previous BB Naija victors and how well they have done for themselves so far.</p><p>BB Naija first premiered in 2006 with a Northerner, <strong>Katung Aduwak</strong> emerging as the winner. Katung is currently a movie director and producer. The only movie Katung has directed so far is Heaven’s Hell. We have not heard of him since then. Perhaps he will come back to the limelight soon but for now, we are not so sure.</p><p>The second season of BB Naija occurred in 2007 with <strong>Micheal Ejeba</strong> popularly known as Efe going home with the pot of gold. Nigerians have often mocked Efe for the kind of songs he released since he left the house and most people have told him to quit music. We have not heard of him for a while now.</p><p>The third season of the reality show was in 2018. <strong>Miracle Igbokwe</strong> won the show. He is a pilot and since he emerged winner it seems he disappeared into thin air.</p><p>The fourth season which was held in 2019 produced its first female winner, <strong>Mercy Eke</strong>.</p><p>Mercy is a video vixen, an actress and entrepreneur. She recently celebrated her 28th birthday and bought a dress of N1.8m.&nbsp; She also celebrated the purchase of another home in Lagos. Mercy Is constantly making waves and it does not seem she will be stopping anytime soon.</p><p>The fifth season in 2020 brought forth an exceptionally talented musician as the winner – Laycon. I am quite certain I speak for most Nigerians when I say we had thought <strong>Laycon</strong> would be making huge leaps a year after. With so much talent, he is still finding his footing. We hope that he strikes gold in the nearest future.</p><p>The present season has brought forth another male winner in the person of Whitemoney. So yet again will the male factor curse play out or will WhiteMoney break the trend and not go into oblivion or semi-oblivion like his male counterparts?</p><p>Time will surely tell, but for now, Whitemoney will surely enjoy the fame, money, and other goodies that comes with winning the 2021 edition of the popular reality show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49sZrCgmamyrrvNnrBmmpJiu6K1yZpkr6GTqbyzxYywoKWkXam1pnnMmqOeZZaWsLW70WaarqqjmnqxuMCyZKitpGKuqK3Ip2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The reason for the heavy security presence according to some sources is the need to prevent any violent protest against the continued stay in office of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni as the national chairman of the party’s caretaker committee."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC of the party.</p><p>Speaking later on the development, the APC Caretaker Committee Secretary, <strong>Senator James Akpanudoedehe</strong>, confirmed that the security operatives were on ground to prevent the breakdown of law and order.</p><p>He explained that the party got some security reports that some people against the leadership of the Buni-led cartaker committee palnned to protest at the secrtariat hence they got proactive by inviting secueity operatives to protect the area.</p><p>He said, “The police is here to strengthen the leadership of Governor Buni, the caretaker chairman of the APC What do I mean by that? Whenever you read a security situation, when you have a security report that we are privy to, it is incumbent on our part to strengthen it so that we can protect you and the properties of APC,” he said.</p><p>“APC cannot be embarrassed because it has the national government. So we have to take measures to forestall any happening. We cannot underestimate security reports. You cannot play down on it. You have a security report, you can’t take laws in your hands. You don’t expect us to call thugs to defend the secretariat of the party.</p><p>“So the right thing to do is to invite the police and the SSS who gave us the report that so so so thing may happen. It is a measure to protect your properties, including your lives. You are media people. If there is a protest and somebody is being killed, that would be big news. Nobody wants that that somebody has been shot here. It is our responsibility as managers of this party to put measures to protect lives and properties.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49yZpuqlZa4qrrGZqeopJmYsm7AwKScZqemmr9urc%2BcZKeZpJ68r63LZqqem6KawaK%2ByJqrZqGeYq6jwcmaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

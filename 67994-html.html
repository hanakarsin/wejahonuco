Dangote, who opened a Twitter account- social network on New Year’s Eve of 2013, currently has more than 50,000 followers. He uses his tweets to address malnutrition, the Davos economic conference, and entrepreneurship although no selfies for the now.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Despite the business mogul’s tight schedule, he frequently engages himself in jogging sessions, according to him: “Exercise is better than any medicine I can take. Exercise and sleep”.</p><p>4. According to Brian Browne, former U.S. Consul General to Nigeria, Dangote receives special treatment from the federal government in the form of exclusive import rights while high taxes or bans are imposed on competitors’ imports, a claim he, however, refuted and alleged that he only maintained friendships with elected official.</p><p>5. The Africa’s richest man is a philanthropist. &nbsp;Through his Dangote Foundation, more than 10 billion naira has been donated to fight poverty in the country. Aside business grants, the foundation usually sends cash transfers to women and children who suffers the worst effects of poverty in order to alleviate their plight.</p><p>6.

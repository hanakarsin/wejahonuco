When the COVID-19 pandemic began, there was nearly a 10 percent spike in calls to service hotlines within the first two months after stay-at-home orders were put into place.

However, that doesn’t mean men are never the victims. Recently, Instagram and OnlyFans model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Genie Exum</a> was arrested after she allegedly stabbed her boyfriend, Frances Amor.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about what happened and their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Genie Exum allegedly stabbed Frances Armor two times with a kitchen knife.</h2><p>On Oct. 18, the NYPD responded to a 911 call from a man named Frances Armor. He said he was inside an apartment on 10th Avenue in Manhattan when he got into a dispute with Genie Exum, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. He said she then stabbed him in the arm and back with a kitchen knife.</p><p>Shortly after, Armor was transported to Bellevue Hospital by emergency responders, where he is currently in stable condition, according to police.</p><p>Exum was arrested and charged with assault. However, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, she was released without bail at her Manhattan Criminal Court arraignment the next day. Her public defender, Brooke Quincy Myers, of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, described Armor as "an older man, much larger than Ms. Exum." He also said that Armor, who was present at the arraignment, told him that he "doesn’t want the case going forward."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Genie Exum (@genie.exum)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Ultimately, the judge issued a no-contact order against Exum, which prohibited her from speaking to Armor. While prosecutors had asked her to be held on $10,000 bail or $50,000 bond for the second-degree assault charge, their actions were futile. After the hearing ended, Exum allegedly ran over to two girls sitting in the back of the gallery and gave them a hug, according to the Post.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Frances Armor is an artist living in Brooklyn, N.Y.</h2><p>Armor goes by the nickname “Babyboy” on social media.

She also has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OnlyFans account</a> where she describes herself as a "free spirit from Alabama with a loud mouth and dirty mind." Since being released without bail, she hasn't been very active on social media, with the exception of Twitter.

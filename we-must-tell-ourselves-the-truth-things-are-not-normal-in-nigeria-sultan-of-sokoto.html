The truth is, things are not getting better. Therefore, the earlier we know things are not getting better the better for us, so that we can sit down and find means and ways of solving our problems.</p><p>“We must work hard to tackle the insecurity, hunger, poverty and all the negative things afflicting our great country. We have problems, yes we know we have problems and I have said it before that things are not just normal and right in this country, but we can make things normal and right by Allah’s wish, so we have to work hard,” he said.</p><p>“People are suffering and we have few people that have so much and too many people that have nothing, yet we are not helping the poor,” he added.</p><p>He advised the government to get adequate food supply and store, so as to sell at a much-subsidized rate to the common man.</p><p>The Sultan also stated that it is time to move away from just talking and take action on how to make things better for Nigeria and Nigerians.</p><p>He noted that the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) has been meeting quarterly to discuss the same issues but the challenge has always been the failure to implement recommendations.</p><p>“We are discussing the same issues again and again without implementing what we have been discussing. That shows that something is wrong with us as leaders and we must sit down and find those things that are wrong with us, to tackle the insecurity before it envelops and devours all of us,” he lamented.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49vZrCdXaLCtMCMrZylpF2kwrO%2FxKWtnqtdqbWmedOrrK2gXam1qrrGrGSaqpViu7DAjKemq6WRoXqquoynoKCdop6ubr%2FUpauapl2ks26%2FzqSmradf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

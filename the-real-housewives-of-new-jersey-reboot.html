She was fired while fellow stars <a href=#>Candiace Dillard-Bassett</a> and <a href=#>Nneka Ihim</a> left the show to focus on family. Fan voices were heard then, so will they be heard again?</p><p>Similar calls are now being made for <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>. Viewers were hopeful for some kind of advancement or resolution following an insane Season 13 reunion special. However, when the season began, the battle lines were still very much in place, and unlike the previous 13 seasons, people were tired of the same old story. Viewership tanked to the lowest the series has ever seen, and it's clearly time to make a change. So, what has <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a> said about a potential RHONJ reboot?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What has Andy Cohen said about a potential reboot for 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey'?</h2><p>Within weeks of Season 15 of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> premiering, it was announced that there'd be a major cast shakeup. Now, with viewers begging for a change regarding RHONJ, Andy has addressed the issue on his show, Radio Andy. A frustrated fan called in and demanded answers about whether or not there would be a RHONJ casting change. Andy said, 'We’re gonna reboot it. We’re gonna do something different.'” Now, he's whistling a new tune.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Andy Cohen says his response to the unhappy caller about a reboot was "riffing."</h2><p>After he made those comments on the show, it makes absolute sense that viewers were hungry for <a href=#>more information</a>. Andy is now backtracking on his comments about the new reboot. In another episode of his show, Andy shared that his comments were not definitive and were not meant to be taken as gospel. He had mentioned that there would be all "new faces" on the show, but later said, “I was … not definitively saying it’s going to be all fresh faces.” They were simply flippant musings, not truth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Andy may have backtracked his comments, but the lack of reunion shows that a change is likely necessary for the 'RHONJ' cast.</h2><p>At the very beginning of the season, it was announced that there would not be a true reunion special for Season 14. Reunions are held to hash out the issues unveiled throughout the season. It has become clear that there is no resolution in sight for this group of housewives. The new "<a href=#>reunion special</a>" is more or less combined with the finale, with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ladies watching</a> and commenting on the finale in two separate locations. The changes being made make it feel like the end is nigh for RHONJ as it is now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmedGemKVlmKTCtLHWoq2eq12ks266xLBko52iqLK6edGemainpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

It comprises a 24-floor mission tower made up of two twin towers of 12 floors each.</p><p>Addressing his congregation recently, Oyedepo said, “Except you are very spiritual, what is happening to us (in Winners’ Chapel) will anger you! The Ark project your church is running, many states (in Nigeria) cannot dare such a project. Where do they have the means?</p><p>“That (kind of) building is not (found) anywhere around here and humbly so around the world. The roof is 18 meters beyond the largest roof diameter in the world and there is no noise, there is no pressure. You need to be spiritual not to be bitter. You need to be very spiritual.”</p><p>“Anything said against our Church today, everybody knows it is out of envy,” the bishop added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49uZpyqmam2pL%2BMnqWvsV2stq%2B6xKuqZpuYlr2muIymmKexXajBosDErGScmZ6peqKyxaipnWWfqr9uvNGooZ6bpGK8urHDnqeoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

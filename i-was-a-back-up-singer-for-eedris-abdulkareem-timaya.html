I gathered what I learnt from there and went back to Port Harcourt. I realised that with the knowledge that I have, I’m not promoting [my music] from Port Harcourt but Lagos even though I was living in Port Harcourt. Because to live in Lagos at that point was too expensive for me. Even to do a promotion.</p><p>“So, I needed to go back and start from my foundation. I left Port Harcourt after I blew. Even Burna Boy, I told him he had to leave Port Harcourt. If you blow up in a place, you have to leave there and love them from afar.</p><p>“Eedris Abdulkareem will always be my boss but we don’t talk… Not like we are quarrelling.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49yZqJlp5bAbq2Mm5ico12qvW6%2FyKeenqpdm7yzecSem6uho2Kuo7DUpaKaqpWaum7AyKaYsplf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

She argued that the men of God can become answered prayers by opening food banks, blood banks, soup kitchens, shelters and dispensaries for their members."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Go and check google I know what Pastor E A Adeboye and redeemed church has contributed to hospitals, @pastorpoju recently gave money to entrepreneurs @bolajiid recently donated money to victims of Ibadan explosion, @mfm_ministries does a lot of charity @daystarng charitable works is uncountable, the fact that they don’t post doesn’t mean they don’t do, so this attack and speech against MEN of GOD is freaking baseless!!. Do your research before you speak!!!!.</p><p>“Stop making the church feel like they are the cause of your mishap. The Church has helped a lot, grown a lot, supported a lot. They might not get it all right, but how about what they got right. Abeggggi!!!!!!. Bible says “There’s a time to talk and there’s a time to be silent”. This is a time to TALK Abeg!!!!!. If the church has also being part of your journey for good this is not a time to also SHUT UP, freaking SPEAK UP!!!!. I am a proud of the CHURCH and I am proud of it!!!!. Any product of the church in the audience?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49vZq2gmah6qr%2BMn6memZueu6h5wZqqnqSVqMBuw86loGaZoqS5pnnKp6aco6Nir6bA07JkoqqRl7yzec6vnKtlk6GuqrnSZpigmZmjwLV5zaKenqqZlrtuvMCsq6iqo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

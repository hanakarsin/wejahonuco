For instance, Egbin, which has over 1000 capacity, has not been able to generate 800MW because there’s no demand,” she said.</p><p>She explained that power generation depended on market demand and Nigerians are not demanding power, which resulted in huge debt.</p><p>Ogaji also faulted the capacity of the national grid to take the whole of power generated by the generating companies.</p><p>She said: “We have the capacity to generate more for the country, but the national grid has not been able to take everything we produce. Then we get blamed for companies shutting down and leaving for other countries.</p><p>“As we speak, there is yet proof that Nigeria needs power because if the country needs power, all hands will be on the ground to ask for more than what we currently generate, and be willing to pay for it. That is when we can be held responsible for not increasing generation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FvZp2ho5i8tHnDnpmtZZiewbR5zWurp2WXmruku9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The Hype House is basically just a mansion full of TikTok and YouTube stars who live together (or visit regularly) and just create content for their social media profiles all day."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Hype House is basically just a mansion full of TikTok and YouTube stars who live together (or visit regularly) and just create content for their social media profiles all day. The house also has its own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok account</u></a> that has amassed almost 18M followers.</p><p>While the Hype House mainly consists of men, though there are some girls that have made their way into the mix. Some have come and gone due to drama and dating rumors, including the most popular TikTok star right now, Charli D’Amelio (and her sister, Dixie). So, what girls are hyping in the house now that <a href=#>Charlie D'Amelio moved out</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Addison Rae</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#><u>Addison Rae</u></a> can hold her own when it comes to being TikTok famous. The 19-year-old is now best friends with the Kardashian family and watched her following grow exponentially in the last few months. It’s a question as to whether or not she even needs the support of the Hype House.</p><p>While some speculate that Addison has left the Hype House (or will leave soon) due to her stardom, she has never publicly stated such.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Avani Gregg</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#>Avani Gregg</a> has amassed 22.9 million followers on TikTok and turned herself into an influencer. While she mainly exhibits her makeup skills on her TikTok, she also performs dances and skits with her friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Addison, fans have wondered if Avani left the Hype House, but she assured fans that it was due to the pandemic that she wasn’t around as much. She is also only 17 years old and cannot live there full time. She revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Today</u></a> in February, "I wouldn't do my homework if I was here."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kouvr</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#>Kouvr</a> is best recognized for being the girlfriend of fellow social star, Alex Warren. She was friends with<a href=#> former Hype House member Daisy Keech</a> before Daisy <u>exposed her and the rest of the Hype House</u> for being fake and disrespectful.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mia Hayward</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Mia Hayward can be seen here and there in the Hype House. While she boasts a modest 2.5 million TikTok followers, she is better known as being the maybe-girlfriend of Hype House co-founder, <a href=#>Thomas Petrou.</a></p><p>In a YouTube video on Thomas's channel titled, "Are Mia and I Dating?" he said, "We don't even know what we are." So that pretty much clears that up, right?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Olivia Ponton</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In June 2020, the official Hype House Instagram posted a photo of Olivia with the caption, “Welcome Olivia” So it’s safe to say that Olivia is living at the Hype House. Olivia is also a model and was previously linked to <a href=#><u>Sway House member Kio Cyr</u>.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kelianne Stankus</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Kelianne, a California native, is an actress, gymnast, and dancer. She is also dating model Chase Mattson. She also collabs with other TikTokers like <a href=#>Tayler Holder</a> and Nate Wyatt.</p><p>Make sure you are following these girls on TikTok!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuNJmnaunnWLBqbGMobCpnV2dvLa%2FxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

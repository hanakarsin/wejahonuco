Source: instagramIn March 2020, Connor Saeli made headlines by not-so-expertly dodging a question about whether he was dating Madison Prewett during an Instagram Live with fellow The Bachelorette alum Mike Johnson.
His fans latched onto the brief exchange, with many hypothesizing that he and Madi might be about to embark on a new relationship."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although he sparked dating rumors with celebs like Madi, it's uncertain whether he is in a relationship or flying solo at present.&nbsp;</p><p>2019 marked a busy year for the investment analyst and the founder and CEO of Sael Wellness, who featured on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. While his love notes shown on Season 15 of The Bachelorette left fans swooning, they weren't convincing enough for Hannah Brown ‚Äî who chose Nashville-based musician Jed Wyatt in the end.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Connor then joined the cast of Bachelor in Paradise with the hope of finding true love. For a while, it looked like things were working out splendidly between him and former Miss North Carolina USA Caelynn Miller-Keyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, however, Connor came out in the losing end once again, as his chosen one eventually dropped him for a California-based startup recruiter, Dean Unglert. According to a previous article by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Caelynn and Dean are still going strong, and they even acquired a "commitment ring" to further cement their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, Connor found love with another Bachelor in Paradise contestant, Whitney Fransway, whom he continued to date for about two months after leaving the show.</p><p>Following his breakup with Whitney, Connor summarized his experiences in an interview with Us Weekly as slightly different that what he initially expected. As he described, repeatedly finding himself in the company of happy couples wasn't exactly the outcome he first had in mind.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Sometimes things do not work out how you‚Äôd expect them to, but it is important to stay hopeful.

It's easily argued that Jenner had the aid of the Kardashians and Tyga to help get her name out there in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>And one of the people who seems to think the title is undeserved is the person running Dictionary.com's savage Twitter account. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Haven't we gone over this?</p><p>Self-made: Having succeeded in life unaided.<a href=#>https://t.co/g0ZHDSkVfu</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/3O48zKsInN</a></p>— Dictionary.com (@Dictionarycom) <a href=#>March 5, 2019</a></figure><p>"Haven't we gone over this," the account asks.&nbsp;"Self-made: Having succeeded in life unaided."</p><p>And this isn't even the first time. Dictionary.com provided the same definition back in 2018, <a href=#>when Forbes listed Jenner</a> as number 27 in a profile on "America's Women Billionaires," where they covered America's Richest Self-Made women.&nbsp;</p><p>The account also links to the site's definition of self-made.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dictionary.com</span></figure><p>In Forbes' feature on Kylie Jenner, author Natalie Robehmed explains that part of Jenner's accomplishment is due to her signing an exclusive retail distribution deal with Ulta, a beauty retailer, in November. They sold Jenner's $29 lipkits in their stores, and over six weeks, Kylie Cosmetics sold $54.5 million worth of products in Ulta.</p><p>Kylie Cosmetics’ revenue climbed 9% last year to an estimated $360 million as a result. Forbes believes the business is worth $900 million, and with over $100 million in personal assets, they named Jenner the youngest self-made billionaire. She took the title from Mark Zuckerberg, who was 23 when he hit the billion mark.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t expect anything. I did not foresee the future,” Jenner told Forbes. “But [the recognition] feels really good. That’s a nice pat on the back.”&nbsp;</p><p>The tweet from Dictionary.com, which has acquired over 67,000 retweets and 200,000 likes, earned quite the response from Twitter users.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bless dictionary.com for always telling the truth," one user wrote.</p><p>One commenter added: "I don’t know when Dictionary.com&nbsp;became roast masters going at the throats of annoying celebrities, but I’m all for it"</p><p>Another added: "LOL. Everyone gets help to be successful, but the girl was literally handed a fortune, a ton of connections, and instant fame. &nbsp;So she does not qualify as self-made."</p><p>While one user argued: "Almost no one is “self-made”, much less someone born into opportunity and wealth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbakwMiopZqqqWK4urjInmSjnZ6jsrM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

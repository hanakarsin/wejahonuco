But let's rewind a little bit. If you need a refresher on what exactly happened to Josie, read on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Josie on 'Snowpiercer'?</h2><p>Josie and Melanie get into an intense brawl, and Melanie leaves Josie to freeze to death. Before all that happens though: Josie was part of the Tail section. In Season 1, she and Andre started a relationship after his wife, Zarah, left the Tail and started living her life in Third Class. After Andre becomes Train Detective, Wellstead starts the Tail Section's revolution. Josie cons her way into a position in Third Class and plays spy for the Tail.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TNT</span></figure><p>But then Melanie picks Miles (Andre's son) as an engineer, and Josie decides to make him a double agent. Zarah eventually figures out what's happening and calls attention to the fact that Josie is a spy for the Tail. Josie gets arrested and then interrogated by Melanie. The two get into it, and Melanie tortures Josie by freezing her finger with a hose with air from outside. The two start to fight each other, which causes the pipe from outside to rupture, and it fills the room with freezing cold air.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Melanie Cavill after Josie‚Äôs death üíî <a href=#>#snowpiercer</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QNZigrZIi8</a></p>‚Äî Jennifer‚Äôs fan üåª Snowp1ercer spoilers (@Chirensfan) <a href=#>August 23, 2020</a></figure><p>Melanie flees but leaves behind Josie, who we think freezes to death. Psyche!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Josie live?</h2><p>Apparently, Josie somehow snuck back into the train, into the Second Class cabin and Dr. Pelton is treating her wounds. Josie is in such bad shape, that she's completely wrapped in bandages. She almost dies a second time when Zarah tries to poison her IV drip (she couldn't make herself do it, though). Zarah told Andre that Josie survived and he of course rushed to go visit her, which stung Zarah.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She tried to kill Josie but changed her mind.

But with Zarah pregnant with Andre's baby, Zarah knows keeping Josie alive will only be trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Snowpiercer fans are confused as to why she was brought back.

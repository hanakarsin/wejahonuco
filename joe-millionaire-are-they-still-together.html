Steven, on the other hand, politely parted ways with Annie before he expressed his desire to date Calah.</p><p>Once their minds were made up, the leads also had to discuss their financial statuses with the "winners." There were plenty of surprising moments in the finale, but are Kurt and Steven still with the women they chose?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Steven McBee and Calah Jackson are still an item — and they're moving in together!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Steven McBee (@stevenmcbee)</a></p></figure><p>Because Calah only decided to exclusively date Steven in the penultimate episode of the season, a lot of fans thought that Annie was a shoe-in to win the farmer's heart.</p><p>But, Steven couldn't deny how drawn he was to the mysterious project manager. Plus, Calah really hit it off with his family when the stars visited his hometown of Gallatin, Missouri.</p><p>Steven picked Calah in the finale, and he gave her a stunning promise ring. Once Steven revealed that he is the millionaire, Calah shared that she was never motivated by money during her time on the show (though she did seem impressed when her beau divulged that he has a helicopter — and a pilot's license).</p><p>Since filming wrapped, Calah and Steven have continued to date. The 28-year-old Dallas resident is also taking the next step by moving in with Steven on his Missouri farm.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kurt Sowers and Amanda Pace broke up after the show. Is he with Carolyn Moore now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>Kurt's connection to single mom Carolyn Moore was a major plot point on the show, so many viewers were surprised when he offered Amanda a promise ring in the finale. Amanda didn't care about his lack of funds (and he didn't care that her own family was well-off), and it seemed like the two would have a real chance at love after the show.</p><p>Unfortunately, the North Carolina native and the New Yorker weren't able to see each other much once filming wrapped, and they've since ended their relationship.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Distractify</a>, Kurt shared that he and Amanda came to the realization that they were "two completely different people" once the cameras stopped rolling.</p><p>Though his bond with Carolyn was undeniable, Kurt also is not in a relationship with her now, either.</p><p>One finale pair may have already called it quits, but the Joe Millionaire reboot already has a better success rate than The Bachelor.</p><p>You can catch up on Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer on Fox.com, or on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymecyio6Whn6Ouqr7EZpirnV2ptabFjKyroqScYsGws8Stn56q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

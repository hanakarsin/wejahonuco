He's a popular comedian who first garnered attention after he became the inspiration for a 2002 <a href=#>National Lampoon</a> film. He would go on to have a career of his own in stand-up and became known for his style of observational comedy. He can even commonly be seen performing his stand-up while not wearing a shirt.</p><p>As of this writing, Bert has five comedy specials under his belt, most of which are now streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. He also has several more coming down the pipe, and he has even made appearances in his own films and web series. It's safe to say that even for having been in the business for several years, Bert's popularity will continue to grow, as will his net worth. How much does Bert currently earn in his comedy career?

He was originally the subject of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone article</a> from 1997 where he was interviewed for taking six years to graduate from Florida State University and subsequently becoming the school's top party animal. Details of his time in college even inspired the 2002 film, National Lampoon's Van Wilder. Bert took that newfound popularity into his stand-up career, which helped reaffirm his reputation as a party animal.</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> report, Bert's net worth currently stands at over $14 million. While other outlets claim that it's somewhat lower than that at around $7 million, Bert himself reportedly addressed these estimates in one of his podcasts, claiming that "I think they undershoot these."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p class="sc-ljslrt jczKas"><span>Bert Kreischer</span></p><p class="sc-htmbXw iarkkR">Stand-up comedian</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $14 million</p><p>Bert Kreischer is a stand-up comedian and actor.

Source: epic gamesThe Godzilla Fornite event is pretty much a done deal as far as fans of the game are concerned, and there's some pretty convincing evidence to support this theory.
I mean, why else would there be a Kaiju-sized eye trapped in an iceberg in polar peak? And why would it occur concurrently with the release of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which hits theaters this Friday, May 31st?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Players noticed a while back that items like dragon eggs or giant footprints around the map. People have also been speculating that a monster known as the Leviathan will appear to threaten the very existence of the island once the ice breaks.</p><p>The Godzilla, or Leviathan, whatever it is, might be triggered by an "Unvaulting" event that'll occur when players join forces to attack an object together.</p><p>This previously occurred with the Drum Gun's crystal monument. When players worked together to damage the monument, a special portal was opened up that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">housed items which were removed from the game's "active play."</a></p><p>A similar type of "Unvaulting" method could be required for players to break whatever monster is trapped out of the ice from its gelid slumber.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Godzilla: King of the Monsters review</h2><p>Look, if you're a fan of Godzilla, then you're going to watch every single movie about the city-destroying monster you can get your hands on, so a review won't matter.</p><p>If you could do without the film and only care about a great plot, then you might want to stay away from the flick. It's currently got a 43 percent on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, and individual reviews of the picture aren't that kind, either.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider praised the fights between the Kaiju in the movie</a>, but all of the extraneous plot surrounding it as being boring, which results in a film that ultimately feels bloated.</p><p>So if you like cool CGI monster battles, then go ahead and watch it, but know that you're going to watch a movie that's been described as "murky" and looks like it's been put through a "blue Instagram filter."
